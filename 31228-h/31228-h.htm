<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>The Lady in the Stage Box</span></h2>

<p>"Hullo, old chap! Who would ever have
thought of seeing you here to-night? What's
brought you back to civilisation again?"</p>

<p>I turned suddenly, surprised by the sound
of a familiar voice in my ear. It was the night
of Christmas Eve, and I was just entering the
lobby of the St. James's, the first time, as it
happened, I had seen the inside of a theatre for
two years.</p>

<p>For the fraction of a moment I could not
remember where I had known the man who addressed
me so jovially. My way of knocking
about the world brought me into contact with
so many people that it was difficult to sort my
gallery of faces, and keep each one mentally
ticketed. But after a second or two of staring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
through that convenient medium, my monocle,
I was able to place the man who had
accosted me. He was a rich mining king from
Colorado, by the name of Harvey Farnham,
whom I had met in Denver, when I had been
dawdling through America three or four
years ago.</p>

<p>I pronounced his name with a certain self-satisfaction
in having so readily recalled it, and
we shook each other by the hand.</p>

<p>"What's brought me back to civilisation?"
I echoed, lazily. "I really don't know&#8211;unless
it was because I'd got tired of the other
thing. Adventure&#8211;change&#8211;that's what I am
in search of, my dear Farnham."</p>

<p>"And you come back here from service as
war correspondent in Egypt (where I last read
of you in the papers as having been carried
down a cataract for twenty-six miles before a
launch ran out and saved you) in the hope of
finding 'adventure' in this workaday close of
the nineteenth century? That's too good."</p>

<p>I laughed and shrugged my shoulders.
"Yes; why not? Why should there not be as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
great a possibility of obtaining new sensations,
or at least old ones in different form, in London
as anywhere else?"</p>

<p>It did not occur to me, as I idly spoke the
words, that I was uttering a prophecy.</p>

<p>"How is it," I went on rather curiously,
"that you remembered me, 'honouring my
draft on sight,' so to speak? It must be four
years since that very jolly supper you gave me
in Denver one night, and I fancy I have
changed considerably since then."</p>

<p>Farnham smiled in his comical American
way, which was a humorous sentence in itself.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess it's not so easy to forget a
face like yours. You are a little browner, your
eyes rather keener perhaps, your head held a
bit higher, your shoulders broader and drawn
back more like a soldier's than ever; but, so
far as I can see, those are the only changes.
You might easily have forgotten me, and I'm
immensely flattered that you haven't. But the
fact is, my dear boy, you are simply the most
interesting man I ever came across, in my own
country or any other. You've always seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
like a sort of hero of a tale of adventure to me;
and, you see, one don't let a chap like that drop
out of one's recollection. I've always eagerly
followed your doings, so far as one could follow
them in the newspapers, and I read your
African book with the greatest interest; but
somehow I never got to hear much personal
gossip about you. Say, are you married or
anything?"</p>

<p>"Many things, but not married," I returned.
"I haven't had time to think of women. Besides,
if I had, who would take me? No money,
no prospects, a man who can't be happy for a
fortnight in one place! What a life I should
lead a woman!"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's one side of the picture, of
course; but here's the other, as the world sees
it. You're a sort of popular hero&#8211;African
traveller, war correspondent, writer of books.
Polar explorer, and I don't know what besides,
though you can't yet be anywhere near thirty-five.
You've got the figure of a soldier, and
just the sort of dark, unreadable face that
women rave about. What does money matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
with a chap like that? Nothing. I wonder
you've managed to escape the matchmaking
mammas so long. They're quite as keen on a
celebrity, in my country at least, as they are
on a millionaire."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, they have not given me much
trouble," I said, smiling a little, however, at the
remembrance of one or two amusing episodes
which I had not the slightest intention of relating.
"There, the way to the box-office is
clear at last. Once that fat old man is out of
the way, it will be my turn. Shall I get your
stall for you, and so save time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by all means, thank you. Are you
alone, Stanton?"</p>

<p>"Quite alone. I'd almost forgotten what
the theatre was like, and determined to come
and refresh my memory."</p>

<p>"I'm by myself, too. Say, old man, would
it be a liberty if I asked you to try and get
stalls for us together?"</p>

<p>"Delighted, I'm sure," I answered, though,
as a matter of fact, I was not quite certain
whether I was telling the truth or not. Farnham
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
had been well enough in Denver, but I did
not know whether I should care to pass in his
society a whole evening, which I had meant
to be one of solitary enjoyment. However, he
had left me nothing else to say, and I responded
with what alacrity I could, little
dreaming that my whole future was hanging
on my words, and the result of my confab with
the man in the box-office.</p>

<p>The play was a popular one, and perhaps
on no night of the year, save Christmas Eve
or some Lenten fast, could we have obtained
two stalls side by side a few minutes before
the ringing-up of the curtain. As it was, we
were successful, and I walked into the theatre
by the side of the tall, thin, smooth-faced
American.</p>

<p>We sat down, in the third or fourth row of
the stalls, and, as the orchestra had not yet
come in, began to talk.</p>

<p>Farnham explained to me that he had "run
over" to England on business, intending to
sell a certain mine of his, which, though vastly
profitable, was the one thing in which he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
lost interest. The other mines in which he was
part owner were situated in his own state, Colorado,
while this particular one, the "Miss Cunningham,"
was in California, and he was tired
of journeying to and fro.</p>

<p>"I've had a good offer," he said; "indeed,
I'm visiting in the house of the man who has
made it&#8211;a wonderful fellow, only one degree
less interesting, perhaps, than you. His name
is Carson Wildred. Did you ever hear of
him?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, though possibly not to
know Mr. Carson Wildred was to argue myself
unknown.</p>

<p>"He seems to have plenty of money," explained
Farnham, "and though he's a newcomer
in London, has got in with a number of
good people. He has two houses, one in Sloane
Street and one up the Thames, a queer, lonely
old place, near Purley Lock, if you know
where that is. I'm staying out there with him
now, as it happens, though I can't say I'm as
fond of the river as he is at this season. But
when a few papers and a good round sum of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
money have changed hands, a couple of days
or so from now, I shall bid Wildred and England
<i>au revoir</i>. I expect to sail for America
at the end of the week, and jolly lucky I think
myself to have run up against you to-night."</p>

<p>Somehow, as he rattled on about his own
affairs, my heart began to warm towards Farnham.
He was not a particularly brilliant fellow,
though a good business man; but he had
such a whimsical face, with its bright eyes, its
good-natured mouth, and its laughable, upturned
nose! He was so frankly interested in
life, so enthusiastic, so outspoken, so boyish
in many of his ways, despite his forty years!
I found myself almost inclined to be sorry that
he was leaving England so soon.</p>

<p>"I should like you to meet Wildred," he
went on. "I don't know whether you'd fancy
him, but you couldn't help thinking his a remarkable
personality. It would be interesting
to see you two chaps together. He's at the
theatre to-night, by the way, with some friends
of his&#8211;rather swells. It was an old engagement,
made before I went out to his house, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
he had to keep it, of course. They'll be in that
stage box over there, and as Wildred has been
industriously raising my curiosity about the
beauty of one of the ladies for the past few
days, I concluded to drop in and take the only
chance I was likely to get of a look at her.
And mighty glad I am that I did so make up
my mind, or I should have left England without
clapping eyes on someone I'd rather see
than all the professional beauties in London."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking the overture, which
had now been on for some time, ceased, and
the curtain went up on a very pretty bit of
stage setting.</p>

<p>There was no curtain-raiser, and the first
act was well constructed and interesting from
the commencement. It was delightful to me
to feel, as I did, that I was no longer <i>blasé</i> of
town life, or the mimic life of the theatre, and
I was inclined to resent the interruption when
Farnham nudged me, whispering&#8211;</p>

<p>"There's Wildred and his friends just coming
into the stage box. By Jove! what a pretty
girl!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>I looked up, because I was sure the volatile
American would give me no peace until I had
done so; and then, having looked up, I
promptly forgot the play and its <i>dramatis
personæ</i>.</p>

<p>Two years I had spent in Africa and Egypt,
and I had not seen many fair faces during that
time of travel and campaigning. I was in a
mood, therefore, to appreciate the delicate
loveliness of English women; but, even had I
been surfeited with beauty, my eyes would have
lingered in a species of wonder on the girl just
seating herself in a corner of the stage box.
It is possible that I have seen other women as
beautiful, many more classically perfect of
feature, but never have I looked upon a face
so radiant, so bewildering.</p>

<p>For the moment I scarcely glanced at the
girl's companions, though I was vaguely conscious
that there was an older woman, and that
two men were taking chairs in the darker background
of the box.</p>

<p>All the other figures on the stage and in the
auditorium became meaningless for me. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
was the dazzling girl in white, and, so far as I
was concerned, no one else in the theatre.</p>

<p>The simple, snowy frock, without jewels or
ornamentation of any kind, was the most becoming
frame which could have been chosen
for the picture. The oval face, with its pearly
skin, its curved red lips, its starry, long-lashed
eyes (which might have been brown or violet,
so far as I could tell), and the aureole of waving,
ruddy gold hair were all so vivid in their
marvelous effect of colour, that the dead white
gown set them off far more artistically than
the most carefully-chosen tints could have done.</p>

<p>The girl could not, I thought, have been
more than twenty, and every turn of the beautifully-poised
little head, every dimpling smile,
told that she was full of the joy of life.</p>

<p>"What do you think of Wildred?" whispered
Farnham, his lazy American drawl waking
me out of a dream.</p>

<p>I did not wish him to see how completely
I had been absorbed, how foolishly I had lost
my head, and therefore I turned my attention
to the two men in the back of the box.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>The Man with the Pale Eyes</span></h2>

<p><i>En passant</i>, my eyes dwelt for an instant
upon a stout woman of a certain age, whose
figure was encased in a sort of armour of steel-grey
satin and beads, and whose carefully-arranged
head was adorned by a small tiara of
diamonds, but they found no temptation to
linger.</p>

<p>One of the men was old, grey-haired, and
large of girth, with a huge expanse of snowy
shirt, and a head guiltless of hair. The other
was comparatively young, not many years past
my own age, perhaps, and a curious thrill,
which I could not myself have explained,
passed through me as I looked, through half-shut
eyes, at his face. Where had I seen it
before? Or did it bear but a haunting resemblance
to some other, painted on my memory's
retina in lurid, yet partially obliterated,
colours?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>I had no doubt which of the two was Carson
Wildred, Farnham's friend and host. What
he had said of the man's personality assured
me of his identity.</p>

<p>It was passing strange to me that I should
be so strongly impressed by the feeling that I
had seen the face before, under startling and
disagreeable circumstances, and yet be unable
to identify it. Something seemed to be lacking,
or changed, which broke the chain of evidence
in my mind. Surely I should have been
able to remember that peculiar nose, with the
flattened bridge, now presented to me in profile.</p>

<p>It would be a sign of a lacking bump of
observation to have forgotten the angle of that
protruding lower jaw, and the strong contrast
between the almost copper-coloured skin, jet
black hair, and large, brilliant blue eyes&#8211;so
light as to appear almost white.</p>

<p>It was impossible, I told myself, that I had
met the man before. His remarkable and uncommon
cast of features had no niche in my
recollection, and yet I <i>knew</i> that in some crucial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
moment I had looked into those pale and
scintillating eyes.</p>

<p>A wave of repulsion swept over me. I could
not remember when I had experienced two
such keen emotions as my surprised admiration
for the girl, and the dislike, almost
amounting to disgust, which I felt for Farnham's
friend, Carson Wildred. Something
deeper than mere annoyance surged in my
breast, that that dark personality should lurk
so near to the spotless whiteness of the gauzy
drapery, which vaguely seemed to me a part of
the girl's self.</p>

<p>"Eh? What did you say? How do you
like his looks? Peculiar face, isn't it?" queried
Farnham, close to my ear.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is peculiar," I answered, mechanically,
snatching at the phrase.</p>

<p>"And the girl! Isn't she something rather
choice?"</p>

<p>"Very lovely. Who is she?"</p>

<p>"A Miss Karine Cunningham. Same name
as the mine that Wildred is going to take off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
my hands. Merely a coincidence, but I fancy
it influenced him in his wish to buy the property,
perhaps. He is very much in love with
the girl, and rich as he apparently is, she can
more than match him, I should say. She's an
orphan, whose father, though he came of what
you English call a 'good family,' made his
pile in trade; and Sir Walter Tressidy, who is
in the box with his wife, was her guardian until
she came of age, about a year ago. She still
lives with them, and Lady Tressidy takes her
about. All these things Wildred, who is never
so happy as when he is talking of Miss Cunningham,
has told me; so you see, I'm pretty
well primed as to her antecedents, means, and
so on. The girl has thirty thousand pounds a
year if she has a penny. Whew! Only think
what that means in American money. She
could buy and sell me."</p>

<p>I might have truthfully replied that the
young lady could have had me without either
buying or selling, since&#8211;for the first time since
my callow days&#8211;these few moments had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
taught me what it was to experience a wild
quickening of the pulses under the casual
glance of a woman's eyes.</p>

<p>She had seen me. So much satisfaction at
least was mine. Wildred had doubtless pointed
out his friend, and her gaze had passed on to
me&#8211;drawn, perhaps, by the compelling magnetism
of the strange new feeling which dominated
me.</p>

<p>Wishing to avoid the appearance of rudeness,
I would have looked away, but I found
myself for an instant unable to do so. It was
ridiculous to fancy it, and yet I could not help
imagining that the girl's exquisite face lighted
up with an expression akin to interest as her
eyes rested upon mine.</p>

<p>It was for me a moment of intoxication, as
I felt that those twin violet lakes received, full
in their depths, the involuntary outpouring of
my soul. A sensation as of being wrenched
away from some safe mooring passed through
me as she withdrew her gaze, and, turning her
head, whispered to Lady Tressidy, who sat beside
her. The latter then looked at me, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
unhesitatingly put up her sparkling lorgnettes.</p>

<p>Farnham had not failed to observe this
little pantomime, and was vastly amused
thereby.</p>

<p>"This is what comes of being a celebrity!"
he chuckled. "They've recognised you from
the pictures that were in all the papers a couple
of months ago, or perhaps by the photos that
were published when your book came out."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" I said, rather irritably.
"They're only annoyed, perhaps, at our staring.
Let's turn our attention to the stage."</p>

<p>I set the example which I recommended, but
before doing so I gave myself the indulgence
of one more lingering glance, and saw that
Carson Wildred was eyeing me with undisguised
interest.</p>

<p>Was I mistaken&#8211;was it only the faint emotion
awakened by the mention of a name not
quite unknown to the public&#8211;or did the man
share in my half-recognition of him?</p>

<p>Whatever the feeling excited by the sound
of my name or the sight of my face, it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
certainly not a pleasant one. The one look I
ventured showed me the pale eyes shadowed
by a frown, and the gleam of white teeth as
they gnawed the lower lip under the slight dark
line of the moustache.</p>

<p>He had glanced from me to Farnham, and
something in his look told me that, for a reason
to me unfathomable, he was displeased at seeing
us together.</p>

<p>At the end of the act we went out for a
smoke and a breath of fresh air, and as we were
returning we met Wildred near the stairway
which, at the St. James's, leads to the boxes
on one side of the house.</p>

<p>"I was looking for you," he said to Farnham,
and the tones of the voice roused the same
vague, unpleasant memories that the eyes had
stirred.</p>

<p>"And we were just talking of you," Farnham
annoyed me by retorting. "I should like
to be the means of making you two known to
each other. Of course, Wildred, you have
heard all about Noel Stanton. This is actually
he in the flesh, and he has been telling me that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
he believes he must have seen you somewhere
before."</p>

<p>Mr. Wildred tossed away a cigarette, and
followed it with his brilliant eyes. He was
smiling, but his lips were tense, as his gaze
came back to me.</p>

<p>"It is my misfortune," he said, "to be
obliged to assure you that Mr. Stanton is mistaken.
I know him as well as one can do without
having met him, through his book, and a
world-wide reputation, but beyond that I have
not till now had the pleasure."</p>

<p>We looked into each other's eyes, and I knew
the man lied, and that he hated me. But the
mystery of his personality and my share in his
past was as profound a mystery as before.</p>

<p>"Lady Tressidy sent me out particularly,"
he continued, "in quest of you both, having
recognised Mr. Stanton from his numerous
counterfeit presentments, and she hopes that
you will come and be introduced to her and to
Miss Cunningham in their box."</p>

<p>Farnham looked at me doubtfully, fearing
perhaps that I would refuse. But, grudgingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
as the message was evidently delivered by
Wildred, I grasped at the opportunity it
gave.</p>

<p>I should speak to Miss Cunningham. I
should know her. I might dare to look at her,
and I might touch her hand.</p>

<p>I have gone through some queer experiences
in rather an eventful life, and have generally
managed to keep a cool head in emergencies.
But my head was not cool to-night. Everything
was dark to me, except the one lovely
face raised smilingly towards mine, as some
murmured words of introduction were spoken
in the box, a little later, giving me the right
henceforth to claim Miss Cunningham as an
acquaintance.</p>

<p>I suppose I answered coherently when Lady
Tressidy addressed me, and talked without
openly making an idiot of myself to Sir
Walter. But I remember nothing of the conversation
between the second and third acts,
save the few words spoken by Miss Cunningham,
and an invitation from Lady Tressidy to
call on one of her "At Home" days.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>After I had gratefully accepted, I turned
to the girl.</p>

<p>"Lady Tressidy has said I may come and
see her," I ventured. "Will you&#8211;may I hope
to find you with her when I do?"</p>

<p>She looked up with a sudden, illumining
smile that answered me. "Come soon," she
returned. They were her last words for me
that night, and they rang in my head as I left
her, dizzy with the memory of her loveliness.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>A Dead Man's Hand</span></h2>

<p>I had taken rooms temporarily at the Savoy
Hotel, not knowing how long it might be ere
I should be moved in spirit to desert London;
and that night, instead of looking in at the
club as I had meant, I went from the theatre
straight to the hotel.</p>

<p>There was a fire burning in my room, and
I drew up a chair before it to smoke an unlimited
number of cigarettes, and to think of
Karine Cunningham.</p>

<p>I had parted from Farnham outside the
theatre, and had made an appointment to meet
him next day at dinner, which he was to eat
with me at my hotel.</p>

<p>I felt no inclination for bed, nor was I in
the least sleepy, and yet, before an hour had
passed, I must have fallen into a doze.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was awakened by the impression
of having heard a sound. I looked round me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
half dazed still from my dreams. The fire
had died down, and I had left myself with no
other light. Only a ruddy glow lingered on
the hearth, and a small clock on the mantelpiece
just above lightly chimed out the hour
of two.</p>

<p>I must have dreamed the sound, I told myself,
for all was silent in the sleeping hotel, and
even the rattle of cabs outside was dulled.
Still, the impression lingered, and I could
hardly persuade myself that I had not heard
Harvey Farnham's voice calling my name, and
finishing with a gurgling, despairing cry for
help, the horror of which had chilled the blood
in my veins, even in my sleep.</p>

<p>Though the fire was dead, the room was still
warm, and I hardly knew why I should be so
cold. Nevertheless, I felt chilled to the bone,
and I was glad enough to get into bed as
quickly as I could. Several times I was on
the point of falling asleep again, but, at just
the critical point between reflectiveness and
sinking into the soft depths of slumber, I
waked with an almost convulsive start, and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
remembrance of the cry I had heard or
dreamed. I was sure it must have been the
latter, although, I told myself, there might actually
have been some fracas in the street
which, in my sleep, I had confused with a
dream of Harvey Farnham.</p>

<p>Resigning myself to wakefulness at last, I
began to plan out the programme of the next
week, and wonder how soon I might avail myself
of Lady Tressidy's invitation to call. She
was at home on Sundays informally, she had
said, whenever she happened to be in town during
the winter, though Thursday was her
"day" during the season.</p>

<p>Now, the Thursday following would be
Christmas Day (this most eventful night being
Christmas Eve of last year), but I did not see
why I might not look in for a few moments on
the ensuing Sunday. It had only been because
Sir Walter's affairs rendered a short stay
in town necessary, that they were spending
Christmas in Park Lane. They would probably
go away in a few days, and I could not
afford to lose my chance; for, though I had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
admired many women in my time, I had never
yet seen one whom I wished to make my wife,
until Karine Cunningham's lovely face had
risen&#8211;fair and sweet as a new moon that
mingled its silver with the rose of sunset&#8211;over
my horizon.</p>

<p>I had laughed at men who gravely discussed
the possibility of love at first sight, but now I
began to realise, half shamefacedly, that it
was not a thing to be convinced of through
argument, but by thrilling, magical experience.
I would have staked my life that Karine Cunningham's
heart and mind were all that her
face presaged of them, and I resolved that, if
she were to be won, I would put my very life
into the attempt to win her.</p>

<p>So thinking, and so resolving, I fell at last
from waking dreams to sleeping ones, hoping
dimly, as I slipped over the edge of realities,
that they might be of Karine Cunningham.
But they were not of her. Hardly had slumber
got its hold upon me, when I saw myself by
the river, looking down into a swiftly rushing
tide. It seemed to be somewhere in the country,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
though I had little thought for my surroundings;
and I was conscious that I was
watching anxiously for the appearance of some
object, whose nature I did not accurately know.
It had been daylight in my vision at first&#8211;a
cold, grey, wintry daylight&#8211;but suddenly
night fell, with the rapidity that all changes
come and go in dreamland, and the only light
was a spot of phosphorescent radiance that lay
just under the surface of the water, floating
gradually down towards me. I knew, in my
sleep, that my eyes were destined to behold
some sight of horror, yet I was bound, in a
species of frozen fascination, to the spot where
I stood, forced to wait for the oncoming of the
light and its revelation of mystery.</p>

<p>Slowly it was borne along with the tide, until,
having reached a bend in the river opposite
the spot where I was standing, it ceased to
move. I stooped down and saw that the pale
light shone forth from a great white diamond
on the finger of a dead man's hand. The body
was faintly and darkly outlined; even the floating
arm might also have been a floating mass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
of blackened river weed; but the hand was
white as alabaster, and as I bent over it, staring
down, one of the fingers moved and beckoned.
Then I woke with a loud cry&#8211;"Harvey
Farnham!"</p>

<p>I had gone through a good many dangers
in my roving life, and had passed through
many a queer adventure, believing that I could
still boast unshaken nerves. Neither was I
used to dreaming, and the hours of sleep were
usually for me a long and peaceful interval
of complete unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Now, however, my forehead was damp with
a cold sweat, and I could hardly shake off the
horror of the vision. It was ridiculous, I said
to myself, and yet, even with my eyes open, I
could see the white awfulness of that dead
finger, as it beckoned me, shining palely in the
light of the diamond ring.</p>

<p>Exactly why I had shouted the name of
Harvey Farnham as I waked, I could not understand,
unless&#8211;with the odd "hang togetherativeness"
of dreams&#8211;it was because I had
happened to notice during the evening at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
theatre that he still wore on the last finger of
his left hand a very remarkable ring, which he
had also worn, and of which he had told me the
history, when we had met four years previously
in America. I had thought it perhaps the very
finest diamond I had ever seen in the possession
of a private person, and he had mentioned that
it had been taken from the first mine of which
he had ever been the owner. He had had it
for some years, and, having grown stouter
meanwhile, the gold setting had cut rather
deeply into the flesh of his finger.</p>

<p>He had laughingly alluded to this in Denver,
saying that he had promised a pretty girl that
she should have the stone when he should be
obliged to have the ring cut off, and he meant
to stick to it as long as he could. Except for
the fact of having remarked that he still wore
the ring, and that his finger looked as pinched
as a woman's waist beneath its clasp, I could
not in any way have described Harvey Farnham's
hand. I had doubtless a general impression
of its shape and contour in my mind,
but I did not now recall that there had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
any recognisable likeness between it and the
dead hand my dream had shown me. Still,
though I was able to give myself a perfectly
rational explanation of the dream, and even
of the impression of Farnham's voice earlier
in the night, I could not shake off a curious
and unpleasant sensation of there being some
duty connected with the vision which I had left
unperformed, or which was yet to be exacted
of me in the future.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>The House by the Lock</span></h2>

<p>I arose on Christmas morning with the same
feeling. There was absolutely nothing arranged
for me to do that day, as I had informed
no one I knew of my presence in
London, meaning to be for the present somewhat
of a free-lance. I had wished not to be
obliged to account to anyone as to my goings
and comings. I had not wanted any invitations
to family festivities on Christmas Day to
"keep me from being lonely." My desire had
been to go exactly where the whim of the moment
might lead me, and without a moment's
hesitation I had declined the invitation to
"Christmas dinner" which poor Farnham had
dragged for me from his friend, Carson Wildred.
It might amuse me, Farnham had
thought, as Wildred's house up the river was
a queer old place, interesting to anyone who
cared for that sort of thing, and they two were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
dining quite alone. Wildred and he had had
some final arrangements to settle up, and as
Christmas was such an "off day," so far as
amusements were concerned, it had been Wildred's
idea that they should utilise it in this
manner. The other man took Farnham's hint,
and civilly gave the required invitation, of
course, but even had it been offered with enthusiasm
I should not have been tempted to accept.</p>

<p>Now, however, I felt a curious inclination
to call at the House by the Lock, as it was
named. I would not dine there, I told myself,
but there must be an inn in the neighbourhood,
where I could obtain some slight Christmas
cheer, if I chose to embark upon the rather mild
adventure of going up the river on this wintry
holiday.</p>

<p>It was years since I had been in England,
and the thought of a solitary stroll by the
Thames along a country towing-path was not
so dismal as it might have been to those who
had not tramped with the equanimity of custom
through African jungles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>Once the idea had taken root in my mind, I
was impatient to carry it out. I would go, I
decided, almost immediately, lunching at the
nearest decent inn to Purley Lock, and turning
up at Wildred's house at four or five in the
afternoon. I would spend an hour there, perhaps,
and return to town in time for dinner.</p>

<p>I had not got up particularly early, had
breakfasted late, and by the time I was inclined
to start it was past one o'clock. I had
over an hour's journey to Great Marlow, the
nearest railway station, with a drive of some
four miles to follow, before I could reach the
Chimes Inn, which I was told was the only
one within some distance of Purley Lock.</p>

<p>It was a quaint old hostelry I found, and an
agreeable landlord, who had hardly expected
guests at so out-of-the-way a place on Christmas
Day, and having finished his own midday
repast, was very ready for a gossip with
me.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, he said, he knew the House by the
Lock, quite well. It was in reality situated
at some little distance from the Lock itself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
quite a quarter-of-a-mile, but then it was the
nearest house, and perhaps that was the reason
it had got its name. It was a very old
place, but Mr. Wildred, since taking it about
two years before, had had a great many alterations
and improvements made both outside
and in. He was something of an architect
himself, it seemed&#8211;this rich Mr. Wildred; at
all events, it was believed that he had made
the designs for the alterations, and having a
great fad that way, had even helped the chaps
he had had down from London to do the indoor
work and decorating. There had only
been two or three men, so that progress had
been slow, and everyone had wondered that
such a rich man as Mr. Wildred was reported
to be should have had things done in so niggling
a manner. But, since then, they had concluded
that he must have known what he was about,
for everyone who went there came away with
great reports of the decorations.</p>

<p>I was not particularly interested in these
details that my landlord had to tell me.</p>

<p>Though, after all, there was an indefinable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
curiosity in my mind regarding everything that
concerned Carson Wildred.</p>

<p>I got away from the man's animated gossip
in the course of half-an-hour or so. I had a
walk of a mile to take, having dismissed my
fly, and meaning, after I had paid my rather
aimless visit, to tramp all the way back to Marlow
again. As I started, a clock on the inn
table struck four.</p>

<p>There was a long streak of gold along the
horizon of the otherwise dull grey sky, and a
rising wind moaned drearily among the bare
lower branches of the trees.</p>

<p>The scene looked indescribably desolate, and
yet there was a certain beauty in it, too. I had
been told exactly how to reach the House by
the Lock, and when, after passing the somewhat
weedy-looking lock, I began skirting
along a species of backwater, and came in sight
of a long, low-browed house close to the river,
I knew I had reached my journey's end.</p>

<p>The place had the appearance of being only
a restored remnant of an ancient abbey fallen
into decay.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>Indeed, at one end of the house a ruined wall
jutted out, with a row of stone window-frames,
half filled in with sombre trails of ivy; then in
the middle came the habitable part of the old
house, with an imposing front door, which
might have belonged to some big Gothic
Church; magnificent windows, that reminded
me of a certain dear old college at Oxford,
well-known in younger days; and beyond, to
the left, was the wing evidently added by Wildred.
It was in wretched taste, I thought, with
its pretentiousness and its huge round tower
at the end, utterly out of keeping with the rest.
Then, as I criticised, my eye was caught by a
puff of fiery smoke that suddenly rose above
the battlements of the hideous tall tower.</p>

<p>I could not quite understand this phenomenon,
for the tower, so far as I could see, had
been merely built with the mistaken idea of
being ornamental. Though new, it was intended
to present the effect of being ruinous,
having little dark chinks in lieu of windows.</p>

<p>Still, the smoke was there, belching out
sparks not only from the apex of the tower,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
but stealing in a belated puff or two from the
chinks in the wall nearest the top.</p>

<p>I thought of fire, and quickened my steps,
meaning to mention to the servant who should
open the door what I had seen. The lawn
stretched down to the river, which was here, as
I said, a mere backwater, and having entered
through a gate set in the side of a big brick
wall, I walked briskly up the short gravelled
path that led to the house.</p>

<p>At least Wildred had had the sense to let
this door alone, with its carvings of oak, and its
big ornamental hinges and knocker. The only
modern innovation was an electric bell, which
I touched, and then, grasping the huge
knocker, I rapped out an additional summons,
which echoed drearily, as though through an
empty house.</p>

<p>So near was I to the river, while I stood
waiting on the door-stone to be admitted, that
I could hear the soft lapping of the water
against the shore. Darkness had fallen now,
and an ugly recollection of my dream suddenly
sprang up in my brain. Just so, I remembered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
had I heard the water whispering, as in that
hateful vision I had bent over to see the dead
man's beckoning hand.</p>

<p>It was long before my ring and knock were
answered, so long that I had my finger on the
bell again. But at that moment I heard footsteps
walking somewhat uncertainly along an
uncarpeted floor within. Still the door remained
closed; but at a long narrow window,
which was the duplicate of another on the
opposite side of the door, I saw for an instant
that a face was pressed against the latticework
of the glass.</p>

<p>"What ill-trained servants this man keeps,"
was my thought; and then, somewhat impatiently,
I rang again.</p>

<p>The door opened almost immediately into
a dimly-lighted hall, when a respectable, middle-aged
man, out of livery, evidently a butler,
stood revealed. Yet I could have sworn that
the face at the window, seen but a second ago,
had been that of a <i>woman, young, pallid, and
darkly bright of eye</i>!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>Was It a Mystery?</span></h2>

<p>"I should like to see Mr. Wildred and Mr.
Farnham," I said, not feeling it necessary to
ask if they were at home. I knew that they had
definitely arranged to be so.</p>

<p>I glanced round me carelessly as I spoke.
The hall was a huge one, dim in the corners,
with a fine stairway that ran down in the centre,
and was lighted by a great branching candelabrum
held up by a bronze figure on either side.</p>

<p>Doors, hung with <i>portières</i> of tapestry,
opened here and there along the hall, and in a
fireplace at one side slow flames crept along a
freshly-heaped pile of logs.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir," said the servant, respectfully,
"but both the gentlemen have gone out
for the day."</p>

<p>He did not look me in the face as he delivered
this piece of information, but allowed
his narrow eyes to drop away shiftily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>"Oh, I am surprised at that," I returned,
"for I have come by invitation."</p>

<p>I hardly know by what impulse I mentioned
this, and as a matter of fact the invitation could
hardly be supposed to stand, as I had last night
refused it. Still, it seemed to me extremely
improbable that the two men would have
changed their minds about the day, after midnight,
when I had parted from them. They
had mentioned refusing one or two invitations,
and there was really so little to do by way of
amusement out of one's own house, or somebody
else's, on Christmas Day. Somehow, too,
I felt impressed that the man was lying. He
had perhaps been told to say that his master
and guest were away in case of an intrusion,
which they might have had reason to fear; but
this could hardly stand with me.</p>

<p>The fellow's smug face changed instantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see, sir, you are the gentleman Mr.
Wildred was expecting. He&#8211;they&#8211;it is possible
they will be in quite shortly. Perhaps
you will walk into the room."</p>

<p>"The room," and with such a queer little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
emphasis on the former word, sounded rather
odd. It was but a trifling peculiarity of expression,
however, and I did not think much
of it as I followed the butler along the hall,
passing through a door, before which he swept
the curtain aside with a flourish, and so into
a passage which evidently led towards the new
wing. We went on for some distance, and
presently arrived at a closed door, which the
butler threw open for me. "It is here that my
master requested you should wait, sir," he said.</p>

<p>I walked in, and he left me, shutting the
door. It then struck me that I had neither
given him my name nor mentioned the mass
of smoke and sparks which I had seen vomited
from the tower. I sprang to the door again,
meaning to call after the man a word of warning
in regard to the fire, but he was already
out of sight. He could not have gone back
the way that he had come, or I should certainly
have seen him walking down the dimly-lighted
passage, there being no door save that at the
extreme end, which he would not yet have had
time to reach. I did not see how he could have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
disappeared so suddenly, but returning whence
I had come, I looked about in vain for a bell.</p>

<p>I was sure now that this room must be situated
in that part of the new wing which adjoined
the tower. In glancing at the house
from outside, I had fancied that the square,
squat wall must be that of a studio, as there
were no windows, but a high, domed skylight
on top. Now I saw that though the outer
building was square, the room within was octagon
in shape. It was, perhaps, a studio, as
I had fancied, but there was something of the
free-and-easy negligence of an Oriental smoking-room
about it.</p>

<p>The walls were hung with embroidered
Indian materials, and a low divan ran down
part way. Between the hangings were panels
of sandal-wood, ornamented with bits of mirror
in the Burmese fashion, and half hidden
with curious foreign weapons, daggers, swords,
and spears, and even a Zulu assegai or two.
On the floor stood a hookah, and on a small
inlaid table were a couple of curious little objects
which I knew to be opium pipes. In one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
corner, as though it had been pushed aside,
stood an easel with a canvas upon it, which was
half covered with a piece of drapery. The skylight
was partly concealed with red silk blinds,
drawn across the staring glass, and from the
centre of the dome was suspended a large
jewelled lamp. It was from this that all the
light in the studio proceeded at present, and
though there was no fireplace, the room was
warm&#8211;indeed, insufferably hot. This fact,
taken together with the studio's proximity to
the tower, made me feel more certain than before
that some flue in this modern portion of
the house had caught fire. I searched the
panels for a bell, but found none, and at last
lifted several of the curtains that draped the
larger part of the octagonal walls. Under the
first two that I raised only a blank space of
dark wood was visible, but under the third I
was surprised to find a small, secretive-looking
door.</p>

<p>There was no knob or ring by way of handle,
but close to the edge, and about half-way
between top and bottom, I distinguished a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
diminutive keyhole, outlined with shining
metal. I let the curtain drop again, though
lingeringly. It could be only a cupboard, or
a particularly secure wine cellar, perhaps, behind
this dwarfish door, yet had I discovered it
in a house not English, but of a country less
conventionally civilised than our own, I should
have told myself that I had chanced upon the
clue to a secret.</p>

<p>There was still a fourth curtained space (the
remaining half of the octagons being of the
sandal-wood), and this, as it happened, was
directly behind the draped easel.</p>

<p>I moved towards it, not intending to pry
into Mr. Wildred's domestic economies, but
still bent on unearthing an electric bell if I
could do so, when my eyes fell upon the partially-covered
picture.</p>

<p>It was but a pinky-white, uncovered shoulder
that I could see, with a glimpse of red-gold
hair at such a distance above as to suggest a
massive knot at the back of a woman's head,
seen in profile. There was a fraction of fluffy
tulle sleeve as well, revealing the outline of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
rounded, girlish arm, and though the face was
hidden by the drapery, I was as sure as if I
had seen it, that should I push aside the curtain
my eyes would fall upon the counterfeit presentment
of Karine Cunningham.</p>

<p>With half-extended hand I paused. The
painting was so far covered, and it was in another
man's house. Had I a right to assure
myself whether my supposition were correct?
As I hesitated my ears were startled by what
I can only describe as the beginning of a sound.</p>

<p>It was low and inarticulate, yet it seemed to
me that it was uttered by human lips. It commenced
with a tremulous, vibrating noise, such
as might have been made by a man groaning
with closed mouth and between set teeth.</p>

<p>I started, and looked over my shoulder, so
close did it seem, that I could almost fancy it
had proceeded from a corner of the room behind
me. Still it went on, monotonously, and
then suddenly rose with ever-increasing volume
to a yell of utmost agony.</p>

<p>Never had I heard such a shriek, not even
in battle, when men were stabbed or shot, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
blown to pieces. So horrible, so long-drawn
was it, that I found myself strangely awe-struck
and appalled.</p>

<p>"Great heaven!" I exclaimed aloud, sure
now that close at hand fire must be raging, and
have claimed some inmate of the house as its
victim.</p>

<p>Though I knew not where to find the servant
who had admitted me, or any other person, I
flung open the door through which I had come,
and ran down the passage leading towards the
main part of the house. In through the second
and wider one I went, opening a door here and
there, but finding only darkness and emptiness
beyond.</p>

<p>I reached the large entrance hall at last, and
shouted loudly&#8211;"Here, you! John, James!"&#8211;not
knowing in the absence of the master
and his guest whom to call upon.</p>

<p>No one answered, and after the horror of
the unearthly cry that I had heard, and now
the sound of my own lusty voice, the silence
that fell seemed curiously brooding and
ominous.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>I shouted a second time, and was then rewarded
by the sight of the respectable-looking
butler. His face appeared&#8211;or I imagined it,&#8211;even
more smug than before in its expression,
and there was something suggestive of
injured dignity as well.</p>

<p>"Did you call, sir?" he inquired with an
irritating meekness.</p>

<p>"I did, indeed," I returned rather sharply.
"I've been looking everywhere for a bell, but
couldn't find one. I have every reason to believe
that this house is on fire, somewhere in the
left wing, near the room into which you took
me, and it is certain that someone has got
caught in the flames. For heaven's sake, show
me the entrance to the tower, and come with
me to do what can be done!"</p>

<p>The smug look was gone, chased away by
one of blank amazement, which did not, however,
seem the sort of horrified surprise that
might have been expected to follow on my
startling announcement.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you must be entirely mistaken,
sir," he said. "There is no fire, I'm quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
certain of that. There&#8211;there may have been
a cry, for as it happens there's just been an
accident&#8211;in the kitchen."</p>

<p>"An accident in the kitchen?" I echoed, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. You see, it was this way, sir"
(the fellow stammered and breathed hard between
his words, as though he were anxious to
gain time for himself, I thought): "The cook&#8211;an
awkward woman&#8211;set some methylated
spirit on fire, and upset the stuff over her foot.
She&#8211;I'm afraid she did give a scream, sir.
You know what women are at such times. But
it's all right now. The flames were put out
on the instant, sir, and one of the other servants
is helping cook bind up her foot. Very
kind of you to take this trouble and be anxious,
sir, I'm sure."</p>

<p>He was glib enough now, but his shifty eyes
were moving about, as though looking with a
certain apprehension for someone to arrive.</p>

<p>"I saw smoke and sparks coming out of the
tower as I came up to the door," I said, doubtful
about accepting this halting explanation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>The fellow flushed to the roots of his black
oiled hair as I watched him.</p>

<p>"Did you see that, sir?" he exclaimed, ingenuously.
"It's master's laboratory up there,
though you'd never think it from the outside,
would you? Something's gone wrong with one
of the&#8211;the apparatuses, sir&#8211;I don't know the
name for it&#8211;and the fact is I did suppose you
were the gentleman who had come to examine
into the trouble. He was to have arrived to-day,
and so I thought&#8213;But I see, sir, as
you refer to the sparks, and seem not to understand
what makes them, I must have been
mistaken."</p>

<p>"Yes, you were mistaken," I returned, only
half satisfied, yet not caring to allow myself
morbidly to scent a mystery where mystery
there was none.</p>

<p>"Would you step in here, sir, and wait for
my master?" he went on hastily, drawing aside
the <i>portière</i> from a door close by. "I shouldn't
have given you the bother of going so far
before, only I thought you'd come on business
which would take you to that part of the house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
This is the drawing-room, sir, if you'll be
pleased to walk in, and I'll fetch you your hat
and stick from the studio."</p>

<p>I had no objections to make to this suggested
course, though I was conscious of a vague desire
to return to the octagon room.</p>

<p>The butler noiselessly preceded me, turning
up the lights, which had been dim, and touching
a match to four or five candles on the mantelpiece.
I saw then that I was in a large,
old-fashioned drawing-room, with plenty of
ancient blue and white china, Sheraton furniture,
and a fireplace suggesting a design of
Adams'.</p>

<p>I sat down beside it to finish my time of
waiting, not quite sure whether to be crestfallen
over having made an unnecessary sensation,
or to be distrustful of the butler, with
his shifty face. I scarcely heard his decorous
footsteps, as he moved away over the polished
oak floor of the great hall, but he had not been
gone more than a moment or two, when the
sound of voices whispering together reached
my ears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>I had always particularly sensitive ones, and
no doubt my somewhat precarious, wandering
life had done much to sharpen them. At all
events, I was able to hear that which did not
reach the ears of other men less favoured in
this regard, and now I caught a word or two
spoken outside in the hall.</p>

<p>"In the drawing-room ... 'tisn't he,
after all ... confound your stupidity!
... fool you are.... Well, it can't be
helped now ... story will have to
do."</p>

<p>An instant later Mr. Carson Wildred had
appeared at the door. I got up as he showed
himself, and advanced towards him, keenly
watching his face. It had been alert at first,
as though he were anxious to ascertain who
the visitor could be; then, as he identified me,
for the fraction of a second a fire of fierce
anger blazed in his pale eyes. Before I could
more than convince myself that it had actually
been there, however, it was gone. He came
towards me, smiling cordially, and holding out
his hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>"How do you do, Mr. Stanton?" he said.
"This is an unexpected pleasure, after your
refusal of our invitation last night, but none
the less delightful. I suppose I'm rather late
in wishing you a merry Christmas? But better
late than never, you know!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," I returned, grudging the
necessity for taking the man's hand. It
was cold as ice, and he remarked upon it,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Rather a chilly welcome that," he exclaimed;
"but I've just come in from a walk,
and we've very seasonable weather, as they call
it, to-day. My butler&#8211;the best and most methodical
of chaps, by the way&#8211;is in a frightful
state because you have been annoyed, it
seems, while you have been waiting for me.
So sorry to have kept you. Accident in the
kitchen, it seems. Hope it won't interfere with
our getting a decent dinner to-night, for of
course you'll stay?"</p>

<p>I fabricated an engagement for the evening
on the spot, and explained how I had felt like
spending an afternoon in the country, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
seeing what the river looked like at Christmas
time.</p>

<p>"I've only a few minutes to stay, really,"
I said, "for I've set my heart on walking back
to Marlow. Farnham knows I'm here, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the pity of it," he ejaculated.
"Farnham's away, after all. You know what
an erratic fellow he is? Well, he got tired of
business, and not dreaming you would come,
ran into town to dine with some people who
had asked him the other day. The fact is, I
fancy there's a fair lady in the case. But he
did say something about looking you up at the
Savoy, if he had time, and as trains are bad
to-day, he meant to spend the night in town."</p>

<p>As Wildred went volubly on with his apologies
and explanations, I did not take my eyes
from his face. It was as open and candid in
expression as a face of his peculiar type could
be, and yet, though there was no earthly reason
why I should disbelieve anything he had said,
there was a vague doubt in my mind as uncomfortable
to bear as a haunting sense of guilt.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>An Adventure in the Park</span></h2>

<p>"Farnham promised," I said, "to dine
with me to-morrow night, you know. It is very
much to be regretted that you have an engagement,
but I hope that you will remind him of
his to me."</p>

<p>"I will do so, certainly," Wildred returned.
"Not that any reminder could be needed, for
Farnham is one of your most enthusiastic admirers,
I should say."</p>

<p>We were vastly polite to each other during
what remained of the conversation, far more
ceremoniously so than we should have been
likely to be had there been any solid liking on
either side under the thin veneer of friendliness.</p>

<p>In a few moments I had got away, despite
Wildred's repeated request that I should remain
and share his lonely Christmas dinner
with him. Somehow, a mouthful of food
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
taken in that house would have choked me, and
I left with the echo of the awful cry I had
heard still seemingly ringing in my ears.</p>

<p>I half expected that Farnham might look
in upon me, as Wildred had suggested, and
therefore spent what remained of the evening
after my return to town at the hotel. But he
did not come, and shortly after midnight I
threw down the book in which I had been able
to retain no great interest, and went to bed.</p>

<p>It was ridiculously early when I woke, and
my first conscious thought was a joyous one,
that now only one day intervened between me
and the call I promised myself to make at
Lady Tressidy's.</p>

<p>I had endeavoured to explain to my own
satisfaction the presence of a portrait which I
believed to represent Miss Cunningham at the
House by the Lock. There were many ways
in which it might have found a place there,
without betokening any great intimacy between
the original of the picture and Carson
Wildred. It might have been an Academy
success which he had purchased; it might be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
even that the resemblance was merely one of
chance.</p>

<p>Still, try as I might to settle the doubts
which, no matter how often discarded, invariably
came crowding back to my brain, I
was already far too deeply plunged into love
to remember with calmness my glimpse of the
canvas under the drapery.</p>

<p>Of course it would be impossible for me to
refer to it in talking with Lady Tressidy or
Miss Cunningham, if I were lucky enough to
see them on Sunday; but in some indirect way
I might be able to induce one of them to mention
it. I could refer to my visit to the House
by the Lock perhaps, touching lightly upon
my impression of the striking decorations in
the studio, or smoking-room, and then, if there
were nothing to conceal, and Miss Cunningham
were aware that Mr. Wildred possessed
her portrait, it would be very natural that a
word or two in regard to it might pass her
lips.</p>

<p>As I was on my way down to breakfast a
little after ten, I met one of the bell boys with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
a telegram, which he had been on the way to
bring to my door.</p>

<p>It was a long and elaborate message, and
glancing down to the end of the seven or eight
lines I read Farnham's name. I then went
back to the beginning again.</p>

<p>"So sorry not to have seen you yesterday,"
the words ran. "Wildred has come to town,
bringing my luggage, on receipt of a wire
from me saying I have just heard of important
financial business calling me to America
at once. Has told me of your visit. Very
vexed can't keep engagement with you to-night,
and that this must after all be farewell,
as am leaving immediately for Southampton
by boat train. Good-bye and good luck to you.
Will write you soon from other side, addressing
Savoy Hotel. Yours, HARVEY FARNHAM."</p>

<p>I cannot say I felt any very deep disappointment
at the thought that I should not see
my friend from the States again. I liked him,
and had found him a pleasant companion, but
had it not been for the strange and unpleasant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
dream which had somehow gifted him with an
artificial importance in my mind, I should have
cherished few regrets at his sudden flitting.
As it was, I had a curious sense of uneasiness,
and an inexplicable impression that in some
undefined way I had done him an injustice, or
been careless of his interests, though in reality
I was very sure I had done nothing of the
kind.</p>

<p>Still, I could not shake off the feeling, and
with an odd restlessness upon me I started
almost immediately after breakfast for a long
walk.</p>

<p>For some time I went on without paying
very much attention to the direction I had
taken, but mechanically I had passed along
the Embankment, so on through crowded Piccadilly,
and thus to the Park.</p>

<p>The dreary stretch of sodden grass, with
stripped trees, and here and there a patch of
dingy London snow, did not look particularly
inviting, but I went in, wondering a little at
my own aimlessness of mood.</p>

<p>I had intended to do a good deal of writing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
during the morning and early afternoon, but
I knew that, even had I stayed at home, it
would have been impossible for me to put pen
to paper.</p>

<p>The ubiquitous cyclist was to be seen in
great numbers and to the best advantage. At
this time of year the "smart set" was for the
most part conspicuous by its absence, but there
were some pretty and neatly costumed young
women, and as I pursued my way slowly, idly
looking at those who passed, there was a flash
of red-gold hair as a slender figure in dark
grey cloth shot by, and I knew, with a quickening
of my heart throbs, that I had seen Miss
Cunningham.</p>

<p>She was going very well, and I was admiring
the pretty back with its girlish shoulders
and slim tapering waist, when suddenly a
woman, riding in the opposite direction,
swerved across the road on her wheel, before
Miss Cunningham had been given either time
to slacken her speed or to turn out of the way.</p>

<p>A collision was inevitable, and without waiting
for it to happen, as I knew it must, in another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
instant I ran forward with great springing
strides.</p>

<p>It was all over before I could reach the
place. Both had fallen, and several passers-by
on wheels had stopped and collected in so
close a group that I could not see whether one
or both had been seriously injured.</p>

<p>In less time than is taken in the telling, however,
I had elbowed my way through the well-meaning
crowd to find Miss Cunningham
sitting on the edge of the grass nursing a
twisted ankle, her lovely face looking white
and troubled.</p>

<p>The cause of the accident was already on
her feet, and in the midst of such voluble
apologies and explanations that I could only
conclude she, at least, had suffered slightly.</p>

<p>"Miss Cunningham," I said, warning the
girl of my presence; and she looked up with a
tremulous little cry of surprise and perhaps
relief.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so thankful!" she exclaimed.
"I was just wondering what I should do. But&#8211;but
you will help me, I know."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>"If you will let me," I responded, rather
too eagerly. "I saw the accident from a distance.
I hope you are not much hurt."</p>

<p>"I don't quite know," she said, ruefully.</p>

<p>By this time we had been practically left
alone. Seeing that an acquaintance of the
young lady's had opportunely appeared upon
the scene, the others, whose proffered assistance
could now be dispensed with, had one by
one moved away.</p>

<p>"Is it your ankle?" I asked, stooping down
over the dainty foot which showed beneath the
short bicycling dress.</p>

<p>"Yes; it seemed to turn under me as I fell,
somehow. And my poor machine! I know it
must have had a terrible smash. I feel far
worse about it than I do about myself. But
the whole thing is a punishment, I suppose. I
oughtn't to have come out alone. Lady Tressidy
never allows it, and will be very cross with
me when she hears what has happened, I'm
afraid. I shan't have a bit more sympathy
than I deserve, when it comes out. I hadn't
meant her to know at all, you see."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>I could not imagine how even a woman could
find it in her heart to reproach the owner of
those beautiful appealing eyes and exquisite
lips, quivering now, between smiles and tears,
like those of a mutinous child.</p>

<p>If I had dared tell her how deep was the
sympathy I felt! But I was only afraid lest
she might read it, and more, in my eyes.</p>

<p>Sympathetic though I was, however, I could
not control my joy that, since the accident <i>had</i>
happened, I&#8211;and no other&#8211;had been on the
spot to offer aid which she might deign to
accept.</p>

<p>"Don't mind about your bicycle," I said.
"I'm sure it's all right, or can easily be made
so again; and if you'll let me enter into the
plot, perhaps between us we can think of a
road out of the difficulty with Lady Tressidy.
But the first thing to do is to get you safely
away from this."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't walk!" she warned me,
laughing nervously.</p>

<p>"Of course not. A cab's the thing, with the
invalided bike on top. But may I be with you?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
I don't see how it is possible to let you go by
yourself."</p>

<p>"It will be very&#8211;unconventional, won't
it?" she smiled. "But there are times when
conventionalities must be thrown aside, and I
shall be grateful if you'll take care of me, and
do all the planning, please." Then, womanlike,
contradicting her own last sentence, she
went on, "But I don't see how we can manage
about a cab. Of course there won't be any
here, and&#8211;I don't <i>very</i> much want to be left
sitting here all alone."</p>

<p>"And you shall not be, for a moment," I
said, joyful even at this small sign that my
presence was not actually disagreeable to her.
"There are plenty of people who will call a
cab for us."</p>

<p>And I proceeded to put my statement to the
proof.</p>

<p>Within five minutes an unusually presentable
four-wheeler had appeared upon the
scene, the unfortunate bicycle had been handed
up on top, and the young lady had been tenderly
helped inside.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>"Tell him just to go on slowly for a few
minutes while we talk things over," she commanded,
more cheerfully. "Do you know,
Mr. Stanton, after all I begin to hope my
ankle is not so badly hurt; and though, as I
told you, I shall be in a sad scrape when I get
home, and have to confess, still&#8211;there's a spice
of adventure in all this that appeals to me,
rather. It's a very long time since I have had
an adventure of any kind."</p>

<p>Poor child, she little guessed how many
awaited her behind the lowered curtain of the
future!</p>

<p>"Never have <i>I</i> had one which would be so
wholly delightful," I boldly said, "if I had not
to think that you were in pain."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is really not so dreadful." She
blushed brightly, but when the lovely rose tint
faded it left her pale even to the lips. "Suppose
we talk," she went on more sedately,
"about the way in which you are to get me out
of my difficulty&#8211;for I think you've promised
to do that."</p>

<p>I adopted her tone at once. "Let us begin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
with judicial questioning then. Was Lady
Tressidy at home when you came out?"</p>

<p>"No"&#8211;laughing&#8211;"or I couldn't have
come&#8211;on my bicycle. She'd gone to an anti-something
meeting (Lady Tressidy is very
fond of anti-something meetings, as you'll
discover for yourself when you know her).
She won't be at home to lunch either, and she
need never find me out in my iniquity, except
that&#8211;even though my foot is not so <i>very</i> bad&#8211;I
shall be sure to limp. She will enquire
what has happened, and, of course, though
my conscience would not reproach me much
for silence, if that were possible, I couldn't
tell a fib."</p>

<p>I would have been ready to swear that she
was not one of the young women who could
rattle off what they might call "harmless
evasions" with a candidly smiling face.</p>

<p>"Suppose, then," I suggested, "that you
allow me to take you at once to a doctor, who
will examine your ankle, and perhaps be able
to anoint it with some healing lotion, which
may prevent the limping you so dread. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
used to be a man in this neighbourhood whom
I knew by reputation when I was in England
last. I remember street and number, and it's
not very likely that he's moved away."</p>

<p>"A grand idea," she exclaimed; but though
she tried to speak brightly, even merrily, it
was plain to see that she was suffering a good
deal, whether more physically or mentally I
could not tell.</p>

<p>I put out my head and gave directions to
the cabman, and when I drew it in again to
glance anxiously at the face which already I
so passionately loved, I saw that it was even
whiter than before. The eyes were drooping
and the dark curling lashes almost swept the
colourless cheeks. As though she felt my gaze
upon her, she looked up instantly, and made an
effort to smile; but the mischievous light which
had danced in her eyes when she first sank restfully
back upon the shabby cushions of the cab
had been suddenly and utterly quenched.</p>

<p>"Miss Cunningham!" I exclaimed. "You
have made nothing of your pain, but I know
that you are ill&#8211;that you are suffering."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>"I am very foolish," she answered, in a low,
unsteady voice. "It isn't my ankle&#8211;though,
of course, that hurts a little&#8211;but I think It
must be the shock, which I didn't realise at
first. I felt quite bright until a moment ago,
but suddenly I am all weak and trembling.
The truth is, Mr. Stanton, I wasn't fit to be
out this morning, especially alone, and I didn't
come simply from sheer bravado, as you might
think, and for the sake of doing what I'd been
told not to do. I&#8211;I felt as though I <i>must</i> be
out in the air, and in motion. I didn't sleep
last night, and I didn't eat any breakfast this
morning, which may partly account for this
silliness of mine, perhaps. I thought I should
feel better out of doors, but it seems that nothing
in the world can do me any good. Everything
I attempt must always end in disaster,
and&#8211;oh, Mr. Stanton, I am so very, very unhappy
and miserable!"</p>

<p>To my amazement and distress, she covered
her face with her little gloved hands, and broke
into a storm of sobbing.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>Friends</span></h2>

<p>It was all I could do to resist the impulse
to take the small trembling hands in my own,
to touch the bowed head with its glory of shimmering
ripples, to break into passionate words
which must have alarmed her, and put an end
to my chance of winning her, perhaps for
ever.</p>

<p>But to a certain extent I was able to control
myself.</p>

<p>"What can I say&#8211;what can I do?" I stammered.
"If there was only some way in which
it might be possible for me to help you."</p>

<p>"Ah, if&#8211;if!" she echoed, desolately.
"Don't you think it strange that, though we
scarcely know each other&#8211;though this is only
our second meeting, and quite by chance, I
turn to you with such a confession? I am
ashamed now"&#8211;and she impetuously dashed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
her tears away with a toy of a handkerchief.
"But the words spoke themselves before I
could stop them. You see, I have no one to
talk to&#8211;no one to advise me. I think I must
be the loneliest girl in all this big preoccupied
world."</p>

<p>"I should have thought you would have
more friends than you could keep within
bounds," I said, hotly.</p>

<p>"Friends? Has anyone many friends? I
have plenty of acquaintances, but I think no
friends. Let us not talk of this any more,
though, Mr. Stanton. I have forgotten myself."</p>

<p>"Forgive me&#8211;I can't obey you," I protested.
"Just one word. As you said, this is
only our second meeting, and I have no right
to ask a favour of you, yet I am going to do it.
I beg of you, as I never begged anything before,
that you will forget how short a time we
have known each other, and that you will take
me for a friend&#8211;a friend in the truest and
best sense of that good, much-abused word. I
swear to you that you would find me loyal."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>She looked up at me in the sweetest way,
with eyes that glistened through a sheen of
tears.</p>

<p>"I believe that I should find you so," she
answered, falteringly. "And, oh, how I do
need a friend&#8211;though you may think <i>me</i> disloyal
to say that, when I have a home with
those who&#8211;have meant to be kind to me."
Her eyes had dropped, but now she raised
them again and met mine earnestly. "Yes,"
she exclaimed&#8211;"yes, I <i>will</i> have you for a
friend."</p>

<p>"Then won't you begin by making use of
me at once?" I pleaded with an eagerness I
could no longer disguise.</p>

<p>"I&#8211;am I not making use of you now? Ah,
I know what you mean! You mean I am to
tell you the things which I have let you see are
troubling me? But much as I need help and
advice, <i>could</i> I do that now, so soon? You
must already think me a very strange girl&#8211;half
mad perhaps. Well, I have had almost
enough of late to drive me mad. Some time,
in a few days maybe, when we know each other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
a little better, I&#8213;But the man is stopping.
We have come to the doctor's you spoke of,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>I neither blessed the cabman nor the doctor
at that moment. Still less did I do so afterwards,
knowing that, if we had not been interrupted
then, it might well have happened
that the whole course of our two lives had been
changed.</p>

<p>However, there was nothing to be done but
ascertain if the eminent man was at home, and
able to give his attention to a somewhat urgent
case.</p>

<p>The poor girl, too, was evidently suffering,
and in a highly nervous state, and it would
have been cruel, now that the opportunity had
presented itself, to keep her for a single instant
from the restoratives doubtless at hand.</p>

<p>Dr. Byrnes was to be seen. I introduced
Miss Cunningham to him, described the accident,
and left him to do what he could for the
injured ankle. Afterwards I had still the joy
of driving to Park Lane with her in anticipation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>I was only called when Dr. Byrnes was
ready to send his patient away.</p>

<p>"Do you know what was the first thing that
this young lady did before I had time to begin
my ministrations?" he jocularly enquired, and
though the girl looked up at him with imploring
eyes, he persisted. "Why, she fainted
away, and if she had to do it, she couldn't have
chosen a more proper occasion. There I was,
with all the known remedies at hand, and I
proceeded to use them, with the most satisfactory
results, as you may see. I don't think
you will have any further trouble in going
home; and now that she has been well dosed
and well bandaged, the best thing she can do
is to eat a hearty luncheon."</p>

<p>Once again settled in the cab, we were but a
few moments' drive from Sir Walter Tressidy's
house in Park Lane, as I knew to my
intense regret. With wily forethought, however,
I suggested going somewhat out of our
way to the establishment of a certain bicycle
manufacturer and mender, who would send
for Miss Cunningham's machine, and repair it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
before the accident it had met with could
be conjectured by those not supposed to
know.</p>

<p>Try as I would I could not induce her to
continue the conversation which had been
broken short. The brief interval that had
passed since then had severed the threads of
intense emotion which had for the moment
united us, and she, evidently repenting her
frankness, was visibly ill at ease. It was only
at the door that her manner warmed a little
towards me again.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe I am quite all right," she
said, in answer to a question. "I shall not
even have a suspicion of a limp." She held out
her hand to me, and did not try to draw it
away, though I grasped it rather longer and
more tightly than conventionality might have
approved. "You will come&#8211;soon&#8211;to see
Lady Tressidy and&#8211;me?" she asked, softly.</p>

<p>"I thought of calling to-morrow afternoon.
May I?"</p>

<p>"I shall be glad&#8211;very glad. Never shall
I forget your kindness to me to-day. Don't
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
think me any more&#8211;odd&#8211;than you can help.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>Before I could begin to tell her how impossible
it would be to think any save the most
reverent thoughts of her she was gone, and a
cloud seemed suddenly to darken my sky.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>An Announcement</span></h2>

<p>I would have given a year of my life to
know what was the trouble and anxiety which
so wrought upon Karine Cunningham. She
was young, and it might be that her youth and
her sex caused her mentally to exaggerate
what was in reality a trifle; yet, even with my
slight knowledge of her, I could not believe
this to be the case.</p>

<p>Many conjectures passed in review before
me, but that which seemed to carry with it
most weight of reason was the idea that her
guardian and his wife were attempting to coerce
her into some course which was distasteful
to her. Naturally, the thought of an objectionable
lover occurred to me, and made my
blood run the faster through my veins. I
could not forgive the unknown and possible
for being a lover, even though he were to her
an objectionable one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>I longed for the next day to come that I
might see the beautiful girl again, but scarcely
in the same way that I had longed for it before.
There could be no repetition of the
half confidences of to-day, the suggestions of
friendship (friendship&#8211;what a mockery!),
the adorable glances which meant trust, and a
gratitude which I had not deserved.</p>

<p>Lady Tressidy would unfortunately be
present. My visit would ostensibly be paid to
her. Already I began to dislike her and fancy
that her conduct towards the young girl entrusted
to her care must have been mysteriously
atrocious.</p>

<p>No, I could not expect much from the
call, having been blessed with an unexpected
glimpse of heaven which it could not give back
to me again. Still, I thought of little else until
the coming of the very earliest hour at which
I could show myself in Park Lane on the following
day.</p>

<p>Yes, Lady Tressidy was at home, vouchsafed
a solemn footman. My name was announced,
and I scarcely ventured to lift my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
eyes on entering the drawing-room, lest they
should tell me that Karine was not there. Perhaps
she was ill. Indeed, it seemed only too
likely that she should be so. I wondered I
had not mentally confronted that probability
before.</p>

<p>There were a number of guests assembled
in the room, it seemed to me, despite the fact
that everybody who was anybody was supposed
to be spending the Christmas season far
away in other people's country houses.</p>

<p>At length, when I had had a few words with
my hostess, the crowd resolved itself into a
dozen persons at most, and seeing Karine at a
far end of the room surrounded by three or
four vacuous-looking young men, I desperately
resolved to outstay everybody.</p>

<p>I had scarcely more than a glance and a
smile from Miss Cunningham, and then I
found myself obliged to talk with simulated
amiability to a semi-young woman who was
anxious I should know how often she had
heard of me and my "travels," and that she
had read the two or three books I had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
idiot enough to write. Half an hour went by.
I had been passed on to other ladies, who
seemed to my prejudiced eyes to bear an astonishing
family likeness, both in mind and
face, to the first of the series. Three or four
people had gone. One or two new ones had
come in, but at last I had had the good fortune
to escape from the latest on my list of acquaintances.</p>

<p>I could still see Karine. She had got rid of
one of her adorers, but had a couple yet in
hand, and it appeared to me that she would not
be sorry to bid them adieu.</p>

<p>At all events, her face was pale as a lily petal
held against the light, her sweet lips drooped
wistfully at the corners, and I thought she
spoke but seldom. The smile with which she
had greeted me had been fleeting, and even as
it lingered there had been an expression in her
large soft eyes which it galled me that I should
be too dull to read. It had seemed to say,
"Something has happened since I saw you
last. Why did you offer me your friendship,
when it was too late to give me any help?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>No doubt, I told myself, this was but a morbid
fancy of mine. If I could have known the
true motive of the glance I should have interpreted
what appeared like unutterable sadness
as mere boredom.</p>

<p>Instead of the earnest appeal or reproach,
I imagined at most the eyes intended to say,
"I have talked long enough with these stupid
men, none of whom have minds above
cricket or football. Relieve me of them,
please."</p>

<p>But I had not even been able to do that,
though I had tried, for as I attempted to oust
the boldest of the group in my own favour,
Lady Tressidy had swept across the room,
with sharp rustling of silken linings and satin
skirts, to claim me for an introduction to "an
old friend who had longed for years to know
me."</p>

<p>At length, however, as I said, I had contrived
an escape, and was finding my way towards
Karine, when, before I had reached her,
I saw her start, staring past me with a white,
frozen look on her face that for the moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
blotted out much of its innocent youthfulness
and beauty.</p>

<p>She was gazing in the direction of the door,
with dark, dilated eyes, and lips tightly closed
in a line of scarlet that faded to palest pink.</p>

<p>It was as though into the midst of the gossip
and laughter and brilliant light had crept a
spectre which she alone could see. Some such
look I had seen in the eyes of a dove which had
been offered up as food for a constrictor. Involuntarily
I turned and glanced behind me.</p>

<p>No name had been announced, though I had
heard the opening and closing of the door, and
now, as I faced round in that direction, I saw
that Sir Walter Tressidy and Carson Wildred
had come in together.</p>

<p>Evidently this was not Wildred's first entrance,
for like Sir Walter, he had neither hat
nor stick. He moved forward by his companion's
side with the unmistakably-assured
air of the friend of the house, and I instinctively
understood that he had lunched with the
Tressidys, and since that time had been closeted
on some business of importance with his host.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>Unreasoningly, I hated him for his privileges.
With more of reason, I hated him because
I believed the look I had seen for a single
instant on Karine Cunningham's face was
connected with his presence.</p>

<p>That look was gone now. When I removed
my eyes from Wildred, and turned again to
her, her delicate, spiritual profile only was
visible. Her head was graciously inclined towards
the monocled youth who stood nearest
her. She appeared no longer to see Wildred
or Sir Walter Tressidy.</p>

<p>I was determined that the former should not
approach her (as he seemed inclined to do) if
I could prevent it.</p>

<p>I hurried to her accordingly, and shut her
away from the room, with a pair of broad
shoulders, and with an air of monopolising her
which I should not have dared at any other
time to assume. But was I not her friend?
Had I not the right to protect her, if I could,
from all that I believed to be distasteful to her?</p>

<p>Presently, the callow youths, whose claims
I had hardly considered, seemed to melt away,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
and I was left alone with her. People were
going, and it was getting late, no doubt, but
I did not yet mean to follow their example.
After all&#8211;despite my dismal presages&#8211;it did
appear that I was to have her for at least a
moment or two to myself.</p>

<p>I had kept my word. I had outstayed them
all&#8211;all but Carson Wildred.</p>

<p>"Have you quite recovered from yesterday's
accident?" I asked, glad to share even
so insignificant a secret with her.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes!" She spoke hurriedly, and
her eyes had moved to the distant group near
the fireside&#8211;Lady Tressidy, Carson and Sir
Walter.</p>

<p>"You haven't reconsidered your promise
that I should be your friend?"</p>

<p>She turned to me quickly, and her eyes
brimmed with unshed tears. "So many things
in my life, though it is not so very long as yet,
have come to me <i>too late</i>. Even&#8211;my friends&#8211;sometimes."</p>

<p>Before I could beg her to tell me what she
meant, Lady Tressidy had called her name,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
and she sprang up obediently. I followed
suit, of course.</p>

<p>"Come here, my dear girl. Mr. Stanton,
this is quite a momentous day for us, and I
can't resist the temptation to take you into our
circle and our confidence," said the elder
woman, graciously. "It is just settled that
this sweet adopted child of ours is to leave us&#8211;and
at short notice too. She and Mr. Wildred
<i>are going to be married</i>."</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>Too Late!</span></h2>

<p>"Too late!" the words that Karine had just
spoken echoed in my ears like a knell of
doom.</p>

<p>For a few tremendous seconds that seemed
endless I stood paralysed by Lady Tressidy's
announcement, unable to speak. Then I
turned and looked at Karine. Her eyes
seemed to have been waiting for mine, and for
an instant I held them with my gaze, until they
fell, and veiled the answer mine had asked,
with long shadowy lashes.</p>

<p>Never, I thought, as my thirsty eyes drank
in the beauty that was not for me, could there
have been another woman so wholly lovely, so
altogether desirable. I could have fallen on
my knees before her, to touch the hem of her
dainty gown with my lips, and cry out my love
and longing for her. But instead I was called
upon to say something civil, and therefore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
hypocritical, to the newly-engaged pair, and
then, as soon as decency would permit my escape,
to go out from her presence for ever,
and face the black loneliness of my darkened
life.</p>

<p>Only a few days had passed since first I had
seen the beauty of her face, but already she
dominated my every thought, and I knew that
there was no hope of surcease from the aching
pain of having lost her.</p>

<p>Had I been obliged to stand by and see her
give herself to any other man than Carson
Wildred, it seemed to me that the blow would
have been more bearable. But with my almost
unreasoning aversion for and distrust of him,
the thought of a marriage between these two
was like the sacrifice of fair virgins to the
foul, blood-dripping jaws of the mythical
Minotaur.</p>

<p>Slight as was our actual acquaintance, when
measured by mere time, it appeared the maddest
conceit on my part to believe for a moment
that had I come earlier into her life I
might have made a difference. But, mad as it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
was, I did so believe. Some voice within me,
which would not be stilled or brook contradiction,
cried aloud that I might have won her
love, that she might have been mine, that only
some devilish tangle of circumstances had circumvented
the fate which originally had
meant that we two should be all in all to one
another.</p>

<p>It was perhaps the hardest task I had ever
been forced to perform when after that ominous
pause, which doubtless seemed far more
prolonged to me than to the others, I held out
my hand, as I was expected to do, taking Miss
Cunningham's ice-cold fingers in mine, and
wishing her happiness.</p>

<p>Then I was obliged to turn to Wildred, in
whose eyes I saw, or fancied I saw, a malicious
light of comprehension and triumphant defiance.
But his hand I would not take.</p>

<p>"It is hardly necessary to congratulate you,"
I said haltingly. "You are one of the most
fortunate men in the world."</p>

<p>"And the most undeserving?" It was he
who added the words, as though he had read
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
them in my own mind; and there was a slight,
sarcastic rising inflection of the voice at the
end of the sentence, as if he put it to me as a
question.</p>

<p>Of course, I vouchsafed him no answer, unless
he found it in my eyes, which have ever
been telltales. But in that moment I would
have laid down my life could I have wrenched
from my memory that episode of his history,
the secret of which it mercilessly withheld from
me.</p>

<p>I have a dim recollection of saying something
more or less conventional to Sir Walter
and Lady Tressidy, and then, at last, I got
away.</p>

<p>I had fancied that not to have her face
before my eyes, that not to endure the pang
of seeing them together, and to escape into the
open air, would relieve the tension of my feelings.
But it was not so. The moment the
door had closed behind me the agony of the
thought that I had seen her perhaps for the
last time, and the poignancy of my regret that
I had not been able to put to her one question
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
which rang in my brain, became well-nigh
unendurable.</p>

<p>I walked rapidly away from the house, telling
myself that the best thing for me would
be to leave England again at once. I had been
a fool to fancy myself homesick, and to come
back&#8211;to <i>this</i>. So far my life had been lived
contentedly enough apart from the influence
or love of women. What strange weakness of
the soul had seized me that I should thus have
yielded without a struggle to a single glance
from a pair of violet eyes?</p>

<p>Yes, assuredly the sooner I got away the
better. There had been nothing save a restless
desire for home to bring me to my native
land. There was <i>less</i> than nothing to keep me
there.</p>

<p>Never to see her again&#8211;never again! I believed
that my mind was made up, and yet I
think I would have cut off my hand for the
chance of one more moment with her&#8211;one
more glimpse of her face to take away across
the sea, even though she neither saw nor spoke
to me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>I walked aimlessly in the darkness, knowing
not and caring not where I went. I heard a
clock strike eight, realising suddenly that I
was far from my hotel, and that I had wearied
myself uselessly.</p>

<p>I must write some letters that night, crying
off two or three engagements that I had been
foolish enough to make, and explaining that
I had been suddenly and unexpectedly called
away. As I had walked I had made up my
mind whither I would go. India would be
rather good at this time of year, I thought,
and I had always promised myself, when I
should find the leisure, to make certain explorations.
There had also been an idea smouldering
in my mind for a year or two that with my
knowledge of the language, and a proper disguise,
it might be possible for me to push my
way into the jealously guarded Thibet. Now
was the very moment for some such experiments
as these.</p>

<p>I hailed a cab and drove back to the Savoy,
from a distant and more or less (to me) unknown
region of London. Try as I might to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
keep my thoughts from the one absorbing
topic by dwelling upon the plans for the future,
the effort was useless. Karine's face was
before me, and again and again I heard her
words, which might have meant so much or
so little, "Many things in my life&#8211;even my
<i>friends</i> sometimes&#8211;have come to me too late."</p>

<p>As I entered the hotel, my eyes dazzled by
the sudden brilliant light, I could hardly for
an instant believe that it was not an optical
illusion when I saw in the flesh the face which
had been haunting me.</p>

<p>But it was indeed she; there was no doubting
that. People were coming into the Savoy
for dinner, now so fashionable a way of passing
the deadly dull London Sunday evening, and
in a moment I had guessed that she and her
party were of the number. I had even an impression
of a sentence begun by Lady Tressidy
that afternoon, which would doubtless have
ended with the information that she and the
others were dining at my hotel in the evening,
had she not been interrupted, and so forgotten,
as I had done.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>There had been a dreary drizzle of rain outside,
and I was conscious that my long wanderings
through muddy streets had rendered
me unpresentable. Still, my wish had been
granted me. There stood Karine Cunningham,
in white from head to foot; a long soft
evening cloak, with shining silver threads straying
over its snowy surface, hung loosely about
her, for she had fastened it at the throat, and
I could see a gleam of bare neck, hung with
a rope of pearls, and the delicate folds of
chiffon belted in with jewels at her girlish
waist.</p>

<p>Her head was turned aside and slightly bent,
a light from above streaming down on her uncovered
hair, and transforming the copper into
gold.</p>

<p>Sir Walter and Lady Tressidy were close
by&#8211;not six feet away&#8211;and all were evidently
waiting for someone&#8211;Carson Wildred, no
doubt, I bitterly told myself.</p>

<p>None of the party had as yet seen me. Sir
Walter and his wife were talking very earnestly
together, and had perhaps moved a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
steps from the young girl that their words
might not be overheard by her.</p>

<p>I knew that, if I were wise, I would at once
take myself off without announcing my presence,
but a sudden impulse seized and overmastered
me. It was a desperate one, doubtless,
but none the less alluring and powerful
because of that.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>"If He Had Committed a Crime"</span></h2>

<p>Karine stood, as I said, perhaps a couple
of yards distant from her friends, and their
backs, at the present moment, were more than
half turned to her. It would be just possible
for me to speak to her, without being observed
by them, if I were both extraordinarily cautious
and lucky. At any moment Wildred,
who had perhaps gone to rectify some vexatious
mistake about a table, might return. If
I meant to take the step at all there was no
time to be lost in doing so.</p>

<p>Without giving myself a second for further
reflection, and with the blood surging to my
temples, I found myself, with a few strides,
beside her. Mud-stained boots and trousers
were forgotten. I would waste no time in
apologising for my appearance.</p>

<p>What she must have thought of my pale
and eager face, suddenly bent over her, I do
not know. I felt that a great crisis in my life,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
perhaps in hers as well, had arrived, and my
eyes must have shown something of that which
stirred so passionately in mind and heart, for
she started with a look almost of fear as she
saw and recognised me.</p>

<p>She uttered no exclamation, however. If
she had, Sir Walter and Lady Tressidy would
have heard and looked round, and my one
chance, so desperately snatched from Fate,
would have been gone like a bubble that bursts
ere it has fairly expanded.</p>

<p>Without one spoken word I made her see
that she must come with me, and the quick realisation
of my power over her, as she laid her
hand upon my arm unhesitatingly, thrilled me
to the very core of my being.</p>

<p>Most women would have refused to come,
or at least questioned my sudden appearance
and intention, but not so with her. She knew
that I had something to say to her which must
be said, and it was her will to hear it.</p>

<p>She had been pale as a statue of marble, as
she stood leaning listlessly against the wall in
her white dress, but as she moved away with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
me life and colour came back to her face.
I led her down the hall to a small public
drawing-room, and not once did she hesitate
or look back, unconventional as was the adventure
in which she was engaged.</p>

<p>Luckily, the place was empty, save for two
elderly French women, who gossiped and gabbled
with their heads close together on a sofa
in a corner.</p>

<p>"What is it&#8211;oh, what is it?" questioned
Karine. "Quick! there will only be a moment,
I know, for they will see that I have gone, and
will soon find me here."</p>

<p>Without any preface I came straight to the
asking of the bald, crude question which was in
my mind to ask.</p>

<p>"For the sake of&#8211;our friendship, Miss
Cunningham, forgive me, and tell me whether
you love Carson Wildred?"</p>

<p>She started and quivered almost as though
I had struck her a blow, and her large, frightened
eyes studied mine for a long second without
answering. Then she said, simply, "No,
my friend, I do not&#8211;love him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>"Yet you have promised to marry him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you mean to carry out that promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, unless&#8213;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?"</p>

<p>"Something&#8211;happens to prevent me."</p>

<p>"If you do not love him something <i>shall</i>
prevent. Let me help you. For heaven's sake,
let me! Only give me an idea how it can best
be done&#8211;I ask no more. I will teach you what
such a&#8211;friendship as mine can have the power
to do."</p>

<p>I hoped to give her courage by the passion
and force of my words, but, strangely enough,
the bright eagerness died out of her face as I
spoke. In some way I had missed saying the
thing which might have comforted her. If I
had only known&#8211;if I had only known!</p>

<p>"You are very kind," she said, gently and
sadly. "I am not looking forward to any
great degree of happiness in my life, but I
daresay, after all, I shall get on as well as most
women. I don't think anything <i>will</i> happen
to prevent&#8211;what we were speaking of."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>"Why, is it to come so soon, then?" I questioned,
impetuously.</p>

<p>"In six weeks. It was all arranged to-day"&#8211;with
a soft little sigh at the end of her
sentence.</p>

<p>"Tell me this: Are you in any way being
forced into the marriage?"</p>

<p>"Not by people&#8211;exactly. Only by <i>circumstances</i>.
I&#8211;I can't tell you any more,
though, believe me, I am grateful for all you
mean, and all you would do for friendship's
sake." There seemed a faint ring of stifled bitterness
in the last three words, though wherefore
it should come I knew not. If she had
resented the warmth of my "friendship" after
our brief acquaintance, what would she feel,
I dimly wondered, should I forget myself, and
be coward and fool enough to tell her of my
mad love on the very day of her betrothal to
another man?</p>

<p>With all my strength I held my tongue
under control, and heaven knows it was no easy
victory, with those sweet eyes looking into
mine!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>"Tell me what <i>could</i> prevent it?" I persisted
imploringly. "If you found that he
was unworthy, would that&#8213;"</p>

<p>She half smiled, though without any mirthfulness.
"There are so many degrees of unworthiness,
aren't there? And I am not near
enough to perfection to believe myself a
judge."</p>

<p>"If <i>he had committed a crime</i>?" I went
desperately on. And the words on my own
lips made me start as though with a sudden
revelation. I seemed to have assured myself
of a fact which had actually taken place, rather
than uttered a mere suggestion. The conviction
grew within me that if Carson Wildred
had not successfully altered his face and each
characteristic of his personality, I should at
once be able not only to remember, but to prove
that my haunting half-recollection was intimately
connected with some criminal deed done
by him.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>then</i>! But it is wrong to wish that he
should have been guilty of any wickedness. I
think, Mr. Stanton, that as I have promised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
to be his wife we must talk no more of this&#8211;you
and I. I have always had a horror of
disloyalty."</p>

<p>"I know," I said, "that I have done an unheard-of
thing in thus stealing you away from
your friends to ask you questions which only
the most intimate friends could claim the right
to ask, but&#8213;"</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, impulsively. "Somehow
you and I have bridged over years. You are
good to me&#8211;don't think I will misunderstand.
I shall always remember you, and&#8211;what you
would have done for me."</p>

<p>"What I shall try <i>yet</i> to do, in spite of all,"
I amended. "I meant to leave England soon,
but now&#8211;I shall stay."</p>

<p>"Yes&#8211;stay," she faintly echoed; "though
you must leave me now. I&#8211;I would rather
<i>anything</i> than that you were with me when
they come to me. I will make them some excuse
for having separated myself from them.
Only go now&#8211;<i>please</i> go."</p>

<p>As she spoke, outside in the hall we heard
voices and footsteps coming nearer.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>Wildred Scores</span></h2>

<p>Karine's face grew paler than before.</p>

<p>Throwing up her head with a proud, spirited
little gesture, she walked quickly to the door,
and passed into the hall.</p>

<p>I knew that this was to prevent her friends
from entering and finding us together, as they
must otherwise have done; and there was nothing
for me to do (cowardly as this seemed) but
obey her, and passively submit to the carrying
out of her scheme.</p>

<p>It had indeed been Sir Walter and Lady
Tressidy and Carson Wildred whose voices we
had heard.</p>

<p>"Why did you run away? We have been
looking for you everywhere, and wasting <i>so</i>
much time!" I heard Lady Tressidy say fretfully.</p>

<p>"I was very tired of standing," the girl
promptly returned, "and of <i>waiting</i>, too"&#8211;with
a certain imperiousness in her tone. "I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
wandered away to fill up the time till Mr. Wildred
should have straightened matters in the
dining-room."</p>

<p>She had contrived to satisfy their curiosity
without telling an actual falsehood, of which
I knew instinctively she would greatly dislike
making herself guilty.</p>

<p>It did not seem to occur to them to enter the
drawing-room where she had left me; and
when I was sure that they had passed out of
sight and hearing I came forth from the ignominious
hiding-place to which her command
had condemned me.</p>

<p>In the exalted mood which had possession of
me the thought of dinner would have been abhorrent.
For the rest of the evening I kept
my room, meditating many things, and becoming
more and more desirous of learning
Carson Wildred's secret, if secret indeed he
had.</p>

<p>At all events, I still had six weeks in which
to work, with the hope ever before me of saving
Karine Cunningham from the man whom,
by her own confession, she did not love.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>Strange and desperate expedients passed in
review before me. How was I to accomplish
my object? The man had denied ever having
met me in old days when it had been mentioned
to him that I fancied a previous acquaintance
had somewhere existed; and if I were to learn
anything satisfactory in regard to his antecedents
I felt that it must be from others.</p>

<p>He had made himself a name in a certain set
in London, there was no doubt of that; and I
set myself to find out, step by step, how he had
contrived to do it&#8211;what was the actual foundation
for the reports of his wealth, his "smartness,"
his influence on many sides.</p>

<p>On the following day, Monday, I went to
my old club, the Wayfarers, which I had not
yet troubled with my presence, and picked out
a man named Driscoll, who made a business of
knowing everybody and everything. Beginning
with some conventional talk about the
changes in England in general, and London in
particular, since I had seen it last, I managed
to mention Carson Wildred without appearing
to have dragged his name into the conversation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
for any special purpose of my
own.</p>

<p>It sprang from some talk about a British
Christmas, and I made as humorous a story as
I could about my having gone down to the
House by the Lock only to miss my friend and
my dinner after all.</p>

<p>"Wildred can entertain royally if he
chooses," said Driscoll. "I've been to dinners
he gave at the Savoy and Prince's, and Willis's
Rooms, don't you know, something really quite
original, with flowers alone which must have
cost a fortune. People come to his entertainments,
too&#8211;he can get anybody he wants&#8211;from
the duchesses down to the music-hall
favourites, even if he likes to get up a conventional
river party, with a spread down at that
queer place of his you speak of&#8211;the House
by the Lock."</p>

<p>"It is a queer place indeed," I echoed. "I
wonder how he came by it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if the stories are true, in a way as
peculiar as the place itself, therefore appropriate.
It was owned, I know for a matter of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
fact, by an Italian whose father was exiled,
and came over here to live after '48, a chap by
the name of di Tortorelli, belonged to a good
family and all that, had the <i>entrée</i> everywhere.
The son, a nice fellow except that he was weak,
loved nothing so well as baccarat. Somehow
he and Wildred got acquainted, when Wildred
was little known, if at all, in society, and the
two played cards on rather a big scale at the
house of a mutual friend. Di Tortorelli had
bad luck one night, lost a pot of money, and
finally, having nothing else left that was worth
having, staked the House by the Lock&#8211;very
dilapidated, and in a shocking state of repair.</p>

<p>"Well, that's the way Wildred got it, and
there are those who do say that after having
won almost everything Tortorelli had, Wildred
financed him till his marriage with a rich American
on the proviso that Tortorelli should get
him into the smart set. Those are only Wildred's
enemies, of course, for like most men
of strong character he has a few, though on
the whole his generosity has made him extremely
popular."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>"Then he knew no one when he first appeared
over the social horizon?" I went on
questioning.</p>

<p>Driscoll laughed. "I never heard of anyone
who knew him before the day when he
first blazed forth as a social luminary about
three or four years ago. He took a house in
town for the season, I remember&#8211;it was the
Duke of Torquay's&#8211;one of the finest in town,
and let for a fabulous sum. Then he and Tortorelli
gave an entertainment together, somehow
securing several royalties, to say nothing
of Paderewski and La Belle Otero, and one
or two other celebrities, who must each have
cost him anywhere from a thousand to two
thousand pounds for the one night.</p>

<p>"After that, Wildred was made, of course,
for the affair was a brilliant success. By the
way, that was the first time he ever met the
beautiful Miss Cunningham, who had just
made a triumphant <i>début</i> as the beauty of the
season&#8211;in fact, most people think the most
beautiful girl who has been seen since the day
when Mrs. Langtry created her first sensation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
in London. Miss Cunningham was at the
party with the Tressidys, and <i>blasé</i> chap as
he was even then, Wildred went down at the
first shot from a pair of dark eyes&#8211;violet?&#8211;brown?&#8211;no
one ever yet was sure of their
colour. Of course she's a great heiress, but
the man must be blind and paralysed who
couldn't fall in love with Karine Cunningham
for herself; and however he gets it, Carson
Wildred has no lack of money of his own."</p>

<p>"How does gossip say he gets it?" I went
on to enquire with eagerness which I concealed
as best I could.</p>

<p>"Oh, gossip doesn't trouble itself much in
that way!" Driscoll laughed. "It only concerns
itself to eat his dinners, for as a matter
of fact, though I can't exactly vouch for it myself,
there isn't much secret about the way the
money pours in. It's the man's extraordinary
luck! He seems to have a lot of relations who
are always good-naturedly going off the hooks
and leaving Wildred fortunes just when he
needs them most. Old fellows in the Antipodes,
don't you know, who might really quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
as well be dead as not. It's all straight enough,
of course, but the funny thing is that if one
hears one day that Wildred has come rather
a cropper at Newmarket or the Derby, or
somewhere else, the news within the month is
pretty sure to be that another Johnny in Australia
or elsewhere has conveniently slipped his
cable and left Wildred a cool fifty thousand
or so at the very least."</p>

<p>Hardly had the laughter prompted by his
own words died on Driscoll's lips, when to my
astonishment the man of whom we spoke sauntered
into the room. He was looking at peace
with all the world, and as nearly handsome as
it was possible for him to look, the contrast
between him and the podgy, elderly gentleman
by whom he was accompanied being much to
his advantage.</p>

<p>"Talking of angels!" ejaculated Driscoll
beneath his breath; "what do you think of that
for a coincidence?"</p>

<p>"Is he a member here?" I asked in an
equally low voice, for I did not wish Wildred
to have the satisfaction of guessing that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
had formed the subject of conversation between
me and my companion.</p>

<p>"No," Driscoll said, "but he often comes
in with old Wigram, who's been a great traveller,
you know, and who now goes in no end
for dabbling in chemistry. That's Wildred's
great fad, and makes the two, who are as different
as possible, rather chummy."</p>

<p>As we spoke on, still in somewhat cautious
tones, the two newcomers drew nearer to us,
greeting several men whom they knew, and
finally sat down. The room felt the colder to
me for Carson Wildred's presence.</p>

<p>Half an hour dragged along, and I was
thinking of moving on, when, as I passed Wildred
with a slight inclination in return for his,
somewhat to my surprise he followed me.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" he said, with an attempt
at an ingratiating smile. "Now, if you won't
think me rude for the suggestion, I'd be willing
to bet you a hundred pounds to a fiver that
you and Driscoll were doing me the honour of
discussing some of my affairs, if not myself,
when I happened to look in just now."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>Here was a good opening for a conversation
unweighted by polite fictions, and I unhesitatingly
accepted it. "Yes," I replied,
quietly, turning more fully towards him, "we
were talking of you and your affairs."</p>

<p>"I readily divined that from the look on
Driscoll's innocent old mug as I entered. I
am remarkably quick at reading other people's
faces."</p>

<p>"I have flattered myself that I am the same&#8211;when
the faces have not been altered almost
(if not quite) beyond recognition."</p>

<p>I looked full into his curious pale eyes as I
gave him this hint, but they did not fall before
mine, and his dark, sallow skin could scarcely
be paler than its wont.</p>

<p>He returned my stare, and was not afraid
to show me that my meaning had made itself
clearly understood.</p>

<p>"Why speak in riddles, my dear Mr. Stanton?"
he asked, shrugging his shoulders a little.
"But as we have got upon this subject, suppose
we follow it up to the end&#8211;bitter or
otherwise&#8211;and as you may not care to take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
all your fellow-Wayfarers into your inmost
confidence, I suggest that we move out of earshot
of the mob. Here are a couple of chairs,
and a table, far from the madding crowd.
Shall we sit for five minutes or so? Thanks.
And won't you let me offer you a cigar? These
are not bad ones. A present from the Shahzada
last year!"</p>

<p>I courteously refused the offer, watching
him with some interest as, pretending to
be unconscious of or indifferent to my
scrutiny, he struck a match and lighted his
cigar.</p>

<p>"I have already frankly assured you, Mr.
Stanton," he went on, "that I am not aware
of having met you before the other night&#8211;Christmas
Eve, I think it was&#8211;at the theatre
with my very good friend Farnham. But you
evidently wish me to see that you still firmly
believe I am&#8211;er&#8211;mistaken. Am I not stating
the case correctly? But it is certainly far
from flattering to me that you should have
almost completely forgotten me, to say the
least."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>"I shall remember you again, sooner or
later," I murmured.</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope so, if in any way we have
come across each other in the past, unknown to
me. But I have been so well acquainted with
you by reputation for some years, Mr. Stanton,
that I would be ready to swear my
memory could not have played me false."</p>

<p>I did not reply, save by a slight upward
movement of the eyebrows, but I was conscious
that he was gazing at me intently.</p>

<p>"You do not like me," he remarked presently,
in the same low, monotonous tone of
voice which we had employed so far throughout
our disjointed conversation.</p>

<p>It was my turn to shrug my shoulders. "I
should not be apt to select you as a friend."</p>

<p>"I wonder"&#8211;very slowly and lazily&#8211;"whether
it be possible that I can in any way,
quite inadvertently, <i>have interfered with your
plans</i>?"</p>

<p>"Rather say," I broke out imprudently,
"that it is possible <i>I</i> may interfere with
yours!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>He laughed. "I wonder how?"</p>

<p>"In no definite way, unless&#8211;I should happen
suddenly to remember exactly where and
how I have met you before. That little accident
might slightly hamper your career in
general for the future perhaps."</p>

<p>"You are pleased to be insulting. And yet,
somehow, I don't want to take offence from
you. I would much prefer to argue you out
of your somewhat unreasonable prejudice and
mistake. Do you suggest, for instance, that I
am now concealing my identity under a disguise?"</p>

<p>So speaking he raised his hand with a pretence
at carelessness, pushing his dark hair
from his forehead in such a way as to assure
me without doubt that he did not wear a
wig.</p>

<p>"The moustache&#8211;allow me to give you an
ocular demonstration&#8211;is equally genuine," he
sneered. "I don't sport a false nose, or I
should have procured myself a more desirable
one, and my teeth"&#8211;with a disagreeable grin&#8211;"are
my own. Have I convinced you that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
I have not tampered with Nature's handiwork,
such as it is?"</p>

<p>"You might have waited, Mr. Wildred," I
returned, "until I had accused you of doing
so before trying to prove the contrary. You
know the saying, 'He who excuses, accuses
himself,' I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I have heard it, though fortunately it does
not concern the case. Look here, Mr. Stanton,
you and I are sitting here among mutual
friends, apparently holding, so far as they can
see or hear, an amicable discussion. But the
truth is I have wit enough to understand that
what you would like and what you mean is&#8211;<i>war
to the knife</i>! Fortunately for me, I am
one of Her Majesty's most peaceable, law-abiding
subjects, and always have been so. I
have as little to hide in my past as any man
can possibly have&#8211;less than yourself even, it
may be&#8211;and therefore I do not fear your prying,
and can afford to laugh at your impertinence.</p>

<p>"I will even have my family tree brought
out for your benefit if you choose, and will engage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
to show you the diary which I have kept
for years, and where you can see exactly how
and where my time has been spent for the last
decade or so. Anything to please a famous,
and therefore privileged, man like yourself.
Is it a bargain, Mr. Stanton&#8211;will you accept
my data if I provide it for you?"</p>

<p>"So great an anxiety to disarm the suspicions
of a stranger might tend to confirm and
strengthen them," I said, slowly.</p>

<p>"As you will. I see you don't intend to
take my overtures of peace in the spirit in
which they were offered. Well, you seem fond
of proverbs, so here is a Roland for your Oliver&#8211;'<i>forewarned
is forearmed</i>.' You will not
have me for a friend; you are indiscreet enough
to advise me that you intend to make mischief
for me if you can&#8211;<i>if you can</i>, mind! My
conscience is clear as to my past; and here and
now I dare you to do your worst!"</p>

<p>Leaning his elbow on the table, his head
upon his hand, he faced me, looking up sideways
with a mocking brilliance in his pale eyes.</p>

<p>"It is my turn to give you warning, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
it is this: <i>I make a bad enemy</i>. Even had I
some black secret, jealously guarded for years&#8211;which
I haven't&#8211;you would never drag it
from me. I believe myself to be a cleverer
man than you, and if I had chosen the <i>rôle</i> of
villain I should have been a successful one,
there is no doubt. You would not, Mr. Stanton.
Had I something which it was vital to
my interests to conceal, I should have gone
about it in such a way that not the devil himself
pitted against me should worm my secret from
me. Had I elected to commit a crime, it would
not have been until after I was ready with an
absolutely infallible <i>alibi</i>.</p>

<p>"Now, if you are sensible, the very fact
that I have made these admissions will prove
my innocence to you. It will be a waste of
your valuable time if you attempt to stand in
my way, in <i>any quarter whatever</i>." He rose
lazily. "Good-evening, Mr. Stanton," he said,
in a louder tone, which he made both cordial
and impressive for the benefit of any listening
ears. "This has been a most interesting chat
with you, one I am not likely soon to forget.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
I hope it may not be long before I have the
pleasure of meeting you again."</p>

<p>He had certainly scored. I was obliged,
hot with indignation and self-scorn, mentally
to confess as much. He had kept his temper,
and he had got the better of me. If my time
would only come!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>Karine's Engagement Ring</span></h2>

<p>In the first hour of my anguish after hearing
that Karine was lost to me, I had come very
near to registering a vow that voluntarily I
would not see her again. Now, however, since
our memorable chance meeting in the hotel,
my resolve was different. I determined, on
the contrary, that I would see her as often as
possible.</p>

<p>Even if I had to follow the Tressidys into
the country on a pretence of hunting, or some
other flimsy pretext of the sort, I would be
near her. I had luckily kept my head sufficiently
to breathe no word of love to Karine.
I had even dwelt with some emphasis upon my
"friendship," as though to assure her that she
need fear no more, need dread no persecution
at my hands. I believed that she did not suspect
my real feeling for her, and certainly Sir
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
Walter and Lady Tressidy had no reason to
fancy anything of the kind.</p>

<p>Wildred had suspicions, I was sure, but they
could only have been born of quick and jealous
intuitions. He could make no charge
against me, and it was not likely, I thought,
that he would choose deliberately to put such
an idea into his <i>fiancée's</i> head, unless I were
far less cautious in my behaviour than I meant
to be.</p>

<p>I could not conceal from myself that the
talk I had had with the fellow at the Wayfarers'
had somewhat discouraged me as to
the ultimate success of my efforts to expose
him, and as days went on I found it impossible
entirely to shake off the impression made by
his words.</p>

<p>His personality was disagreeably magnetic
to me. I had to acknowledge its power, and in
spite of myself there were moments when I
felt daunted by his defiance.</p>

<p>Had he not been very sure of himself he
would not have dared to say what he had said.
I believed, as firmly as ever, that there was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
black spot in his past, upon which I could put
my finger if only I could place him in my
mental gallery of photographs, in which his
portrait had been so mysteriously blurred or
changed. But he and Karine Cunningham
would in all probability be man and wife at the
end of six weeks; and six weeks was, after all,
but a short space in which to tear the mask
from so preternaturally clever a scoundrel.</p>

<p>I thought then (and even yet, I trust) that
my resolution to save Karine from this man, if
I were able to do so, was not all selfishness.</p>

<p>Knowing nothing, yet suspecting much with
haunting vagueness, it seemed a horrible desecration
to me that the beautiful, gentle girl
should be given up to Wildred. I had little
enough hope for myself with her, whatever
might betide, for even had it been possible,
under happier circumstances, that she could
have learned to care for me, she and her friends
would be sure to misunderstand and condemn
my motives in working against the man she
had promised to marry.</p>

<p>Should I have the good fortune to show him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
to her and those in authority over her, as the
villain I believed him to be, I could not imagine
myself ever attempting to take selfish
advantage of his downfall.</p>

<p>What I might do, or try to do, I told myself,
must be without any hope of future reward.</p>

<p>I had persuaded myself that the oftener I
could see Karine, and impress upon her the
strength and disinterestedness of my friendship,
silently assuring her of my unforgotten
resolve to help, the better it would be for her.
She had said once that she had "many acquaintances
but no friends," and she had
seemed glad to welcome my friendship; so that
now I wanted her to see I did not mean to fail
her&#8211;that, after all, it might not be as she had
thought, <i>too late</i>. At least, I succeeded in
convincing myself that these were my only
motives in calling again within the week on
Lady Tressidy.</p>

<p>It was Thursday, and the family was to flit
away to the country on the following afternoon.
I was informed of this by the footman,
whose duty it was to tell me that his mistress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
was superintending her packing at the moment,
but would be down almost immediately.
Meanwhile, Miss Cunningham was in Lady
Tressidy's boudoir, and would see me.</p>

<p>I could scarcely believe in my good luck, and
in her courage&#8211;or good nature.</p>

<p>She had been writing at a little davenport
by the window, but rose to receive me, and extended
her hand. To the other&#8211;the left&#8211;she
had transferred the pen, with the ink still wet,
and so it was that as she greeted me my eyes
fell upon a ring which had not before adorned
her finger.</p>

<p>It was the third of the left hand, and to my
amazement I recognised the magnificent diamond&#8211;still
in the old setting&#8211;worn for so
many years by Harvey Farnham.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>"Kismet and Miss Cunningham"</span></h2>

<p>Had I paused for an instant's reflection I
must have felt that it would be impossible for
me to take any open notice of the ring, but so
great was my surprise at seeing Harvey Farnham's
treasured possession on Miss Cunningham's
finger that involuntarily I uttered a
slight exclamation.</p>

<p>Biting her lip she hastily withdrew the hand,
dashing the pen she had been holding with a
petulant little gesture on to the desk where she
had been writing.</p>

<p>"Why do you look so astonished," she cried,
a certain bitterness in her voice, "at seeing me
wear the sign of my bondage?"</p>

<p>She tried to laugh as she spoke, giving an
effect of lightness to the words, but the effort
was a failure.</p>

<p>I would not let her continue to think that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
she was right in the guess she had made as to
my emotion.</p>

<p>"It was not wholly that, Miss Cunningham,"
I returned. "Say, rather I was surprised
at seeing you wear this particular ring."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a remarkable one, isn't it? Far too
gorgeous and conspicuous to please me, for
myself; but Mr. Wildred was anxious for me
to have it. I believe it has been in his family
a long time, and has been handed down from
generation to generation of betrothed brides&#8211;happier
than myself." The last three words
were spoken almost in a whisper, but I heard
and understood them as I would have understood
the faintest murmur from those lips so
dearly loved.</p>

<p>Some dim awakening thought, scarcely clear
to my own consciousness, stirred in my mind at
her strange announcement. I could not resist
further questioning.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Wildred tell you that the ring
was an heirloom in his family?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There is a romance attached to it."</p>

<p>She sighed faintly, as though at the death
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
of romance in her own young life. Then, more
quickly&#8211;</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Stanton? Why do you ask me
that?"</p>

<p>I could not tell her why; but my heart was
bounding with a new excitement.</p>

<p>"Forgive my curiosity," I said evasively.
"I am interested in all that concerns you."</p>

<p>She turned from me, ostensibly to arrange
her scattered papers on the little davenport,
and, relieved of the thraldom of those lovely
eyes, I endeavoured to collect my scattered
thoughts.</p>

<p>Somehow I felt that I was on the eve of a
discovery which might be of vast importance in
both our lives. How had Wildred obtained
that ring from Harvey Farnham? Why had
he lied about it to Karine? That he was a
villain and a schemer I was sure, though I had
had no possible means of proving it. What if
this seemingly small matter should put a clue
into my hands.</p>

<p>So clever a scoundrel should not have committed
himself to a lie thus easily disproved, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
thought. Only <i>necessary</i> lies were worth the
risk for a man of acumen such as his. But even
the most crafty of mortals is fallible, I reflected,
and liable to make some insignificant
mistake, which, like one stone wrongly placed
in the foundation of a vast building, renders
the whole structure unstable. Possibly Wildred
had found a stealthy pleasure in weaving
a pretty romance round the ring which he had
chosen as the sign of his betrothal, and in
weaving it he had forgotten that I, as an acquaintance
of Farnham's, might have been
conversant with its real history. Or, perhaps,
he had not counted upon the fact that Karine
might retell the version he had given her to me.</p>

<p>I know how greatly Farnham had valued
the marvellous diamond, in its quaint setting,
and I remembered how, only on the night of
our last meeting, he had reiterated to me his
determination to keep it. It was too small to
be removed save by cutting, he had said, and I
had satisfied myself by observation that he had
not exaggerated.</p>

<p>He must, then, have gone so far as to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
the ring cut from his finger before sailing for
America, that he might leave it as a parting
pledge of friendship with Carson Wildred.</p>

<p>The rich, red gold circlet hung loosely
enough, however, on Karine's slim little finger,
and a sudden strong desire that she should allow
me to look at it caught hold of me.</p>

<p>"Would it be asking too much," I said, "to
have the wonderful heirloom in my hand to examine
for a moment?"</p>

<p>Without a word she slipped the ring off and
gave it to me, almost as though it was a relief
to feel its absence.</p>

<p>In a flash a certain recollection had leaped
into my mind. There was an inscription inside,
Harvey Farnham had told me. If the ring
had been cut doubtless the words written
within would show some trace of the violent
treatment to which the band of gold had been
subjected; and I wished, for a reason I hardly
dared admit to myself, to ascertain if this were
the case.</p>

<p>I moved towards the window and, ostensibly
catching the light upon the facets of the matchless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
stone, peeped into the circlet. To my surprise
the words inscribed on the gold were
"Kismet and Miss Cunningham." They were
absolutely unbroken, not a letter blurred, and
the surface of the ring gave the appearance
of having been untouched since first it was
fashioned. I was certain that it had not been
cut. This being so, how had the thing been
removed from the finger of its owner?</p>

<p>"You are wondering at the words written inside,
aren't you?" Karine asked, coming a little
nearer to me. "It does seem extraordinary
that they should be there, doesn't it, when you
think that the ring was made many years ago,
and was not intended for me at all? But&#8211;Mr.
Wildred has explained the mystery, which is
a part of the history of the heirloom, and accounts
for his being particularly anxious for
me to wear it."</p>

<p>I, too, could have explained the "mystery."
I had been told by Farnham that the stone had
come from the first diamond mine in which he
had been interested. It had been fancifully
dubbed "Kismet," and the gold mine, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
he had lately sold to Carson Wildred, had (as
he had informed me that night of our meeting
at the theatre) rejoiced in the name of the
"Miss Cunningham." Doubtless the inscription
was intended to commemorate the fact
that the gold forming the ring had been taken
from the one mine, the diamond from the other.
But, knowing all this, I was none the less anxious
to hear what Karine might have to say.</p>

<p>"It does sound an odd coincidence," I remarked.
"Will you tell me the story?"</p>

<p>I had a very specific object in carrying on
this conversation; but as for Karine, I could
feel that her part of it was sustained merely
for the sake of keeping me from treading upon
more dangerous ground. Yet despite this
nervous anxiety of hers, I could see&#8211;or I
flattered myself&#8211;that she was vaguely surprised
and piqued that I should be willing to
discuss so trifling a subject during the fleeting
moments before Lady Tressidy might be expected
to appear.</p>

<p>"You may hear the little romance if you
like," the girl said, a faint wistfulness in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
sweet voice. "Sixty or seventy years ago, Mr.
Wildred tells me, a very dashing ancestor of
his fell in love with a Miss Cunningham. That
is not a very uncommon name, you know. He
was penniless, and she an heiress. Her father
would have nothing to do with him, and told
him he need not hope to win his daughter unless
within a year he could afford to buy her
the finest diamond betrothal ring ever seen in
the country.</p>

<p>"The lover vowed it was 'Kismet' that he
should marry Miss Cunningham, and swore
to return and claim her, by slipping such a ring
on her finger, exactly twelve months from the
day he was sent away.</p>

<p>"He had the most extraordinary adventures
in search of a fortune, always ending in failure,
until the last month of the appointed time.
He was in India, working in the diamond
mines, when one day he found this very stone.</p>

<p>"He sailed at once for England, had the
ring made, and the words you see engraved
inside. As he had said, he arrived on the very
day appointed, but only to find the girl coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
out from church after her marriage with
another man. He threw the ring at her feet,
and flung himself away; but at her death it
was sent back to him again, and though he
never married, he gave it to his brother's bride
on her wedding-day. Since then it has remained
in the Wildred family."</p>

<p>I could have laughed aloud at this sentimental
tale invented by the man (whom I now
believed had somehow contrived to steal the
jewel) to account for the commonplace words
it would have been difficult to erase. Had I
laughed, however, my laughter would have
been bitter indeed, ending in an even increased
desire to save from him and his trickery the
girl I loved.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that I did not laugh, but
something of what was in my mind must have
been visible on my face, for Karine, as she
finished her story, looked up at me searchingly.
"What are you hiding from me, Mr. Stanton?"
she anxiously questioned. "It is about
the ring&#8211;and if you are my friend, as you
say, you will not keep it a secret from me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>"It <i>is</i> about the ring, Miss Cunningham,"
I replied impulsively. "I can't tell you all,
for the facts have hardly yet grouped themselves
in my own brain. But if they have such
bearing upon your happiness as I have some
reason to think, you shall know them as soon
as I can make them clear to you. Will you
trust me meanwhile&#8211;will you try to remember
that I am striving to collect facts which may
help to release you from the necessity for an
unworthy marriage? Never for one moment
since I saw you last have I let slip the hope
of saving you from what you confessed must
be a blighted future. Now, I may be mistaken,
but I believe that I begin to see my way!"</p>

<p>She looked at the ring, which I had returned
to her, with startled, dilating eyes. "Something
connected with <i>this</i>!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes. It is as if I had placed my eye to
that little circlet, looking through it as through
a spyglass towards my goal. I shall work
after this, Miss Cunningham, as I could not
work before, because I have now a fixed starting-point.
It may be an intricate tangle that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
I shall have to unravel, it may be a tedious task,
yet&#8213;"</p>

<p>"There are only six weeks&#8211;<i>less</i> than six
weeks to do it in!" she murmured, but a faint
colour had sprung to her cheeks, a light of hope
to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Is it not possible," I begged, "if I find
myself near success, yet stopped temporarily
midway by some unforeseen obstacle, that you
can delay your marriage? Let me have that
to hope for. It will help me to win."</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly, and the rose-flush
died.</p>

<p>"It is useless to think of it," she said. "You
may imagine, since I have confessed so much
to you, that it was not <i>my</i> plan to name such
an early date. It was Mr. Wildred who suggested
it&#8211;indeed, he insisted, and unfortunately
he is in a position to insist."</p>

<p>"Has nothing changed since we met at the
Savoy?" I hurriedly asked. "Can't you explain
to me the power which you admitted then
that this man holds over you?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>nothing</i> is changed, Mr. Stanton!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
The reason that I cannot explain is&#8211;a part of
his power, if you like to call it that."</p>

<p>"Heaven knows I do <i>not</i> like it!" I exclaimed,
almost savagely. And as the words
fell from my lips Lady Tressidy entered the
room. She had finished superintending her
packing, and the sight of her was a sudden
sharp reminder that next day she would take
Karine away.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>An Extra Special</span></h2>

<p>Lady Tressidy was so full of plans for the
future&#8211;Karine's future with Carson Wildred&#8211;that
my soul sickened of her chatter, and I
took myself off as soon as it was decently possible
to do so. With no further chance of
private talk with Karine much of my incentive
for remaining was gone, at all events, and I
was anxious to think out the puzzle regarding
the transfer of the ring.</p>

<p>To recapitulate, Farnham had announced
his intention of keeping it until the necessity
arose for having it cut from his finger. Still,
it seemed he had not kept it, and it had not been
cut off. The conviction was strong within me
that Wildred had obtained the jewel by foul
play. Yet how could he have done this, short
of severing from the hand the finger that had
worn it?</p>

<p>Strange fancies flitted luridly through my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
brain. In a few days more Harvey Farnham
would have landed in New York, and I could
reach him there at the hotel he had mentioned
as his favourite; or in Denver, Colorado, if he
had chosen to pursue his homeward journey
without a night's delay.</p>

<p>I counted the hours which must pass before
I could attempt any such communication, and
they seemed to rise like a high wall between me
and my hopes and my suspicions.</p>

<p>As I walked homeward, involuntarily hastening
my footsteps, I heard the newsboys
crying out some item of intelligence for the
evening papers. "Extry Speshul! Extry
Speshul!" "Mysterious Discovery in the
Thames!"</p>

<p>So preoccupied was I that the words passed
into my ears without making any definite impression
on my mind; or, if they did, it was
the mere rhythm of the different shouting
voices that impressed itself upon me.</p>

<p>So often were they repeated from all sides
as I walked on that at length the short sentences
began to form a species of intoned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
accompaniment to my thoughts, without assuming
a separate importance in my consciousness.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, a grimy infant of tender
years and appalling precocity flourished a
pink sheet, smelling of the printer's ink, directly
under my eyes.</p>

<p>"Buy a paper, guv-nor!" he cajoled me.
"Hall abeout the 'orrid murder and the 'eadless
man."</p>

<p>I seldom read evening papers, and to-night,
of all nights, I had little inclination for such
irrelevant mental diet. But I flung the child
a copper, and found the halfpenny journal
thrust into my hand.</p>

<p>I would have tossed it from me carelessly,
but the headlines relating to the latest sensation
caught my eye.</p>

<p>Then, forgetful of the crowds who stared
at me in my agitation, I strode nearer to the
white ball of electric light which had shone
down upon the page.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A Mystery of the Thames</span></h2>

<p>It was the name, Purley Lock, which had
fastened my attention. "Horrible Discovery
near Purley Lock!" the headline announced.
I read on, rapidly, but thoughtfully. Two
boys from Great Marlow had, it seemed, been
wandering beside the river bank, between that
village and Purley Lock. Straying along a
small backwater, leading out from a larger
one, they had noticed a peculiar object caught
among a number of reeds. One of the boys
had curiously poked at it with his stick,
bringing it nearer to the shore, when it
appeared to be a heavy, almost formless,
mass sewn up in a rough sack. The boys, being
frightened, had run home with their story,
and a member of the local police force, going
to the spot, had found the children's suspicions
confirmed. The unclothed body of a man,
partially consumed by fire and lacking the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
head, as well as otherwise mutilated in a seemingly
aimless way, had been doubled up and
sewn in the sack. Weights had evidently been
attached to the horrible bundle, but had in
some manner become detached. So far no
clue whatever, either as to the identity of the
murdered man, or that of the murderer, had
been brought to light. The body had been in
the water for some days, but might still have
been recognisable had the head not been removed.</p>

<p>The horror of my dream on Christmas Eve
came back to me as I read. No doubt there
had been many river mysteries and "shocking
discoveries" in the Thames, and perhaps I had
read of them, dismissing them from my mind
with the alacrity with which one does rid one's
thoughts of such sordid tragedies, when they
do not happen to concern oneself or one's acquaintances.
But this tragedy I could not so
dismiss.</p>

<p>I could even picture the very spot where the
boys must have seen the sack caught among
the dry and rattling reeds. "A small backwater
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
leading out of a larger one, between
Great Marlow and Purley Lock." The larger
one was doubtless that on which Carson Wildred's
house was situated; the smaller one&#8211;a
mere alley of water, leading away under a
drooping tangle of willow and chestnut
branches&#8211;one had to pass in walking from
Purley to the House by the Lock. I was sure,
as I recalled the place in memory, that the
scene of the discovered mystery could have
been no other than this.</p>

<p>Having read to the end, I folded up the
paper and put it away in a pocket of my greatcoat
for future reference. Then I began
walking slowly on towards the Savoy Hotel.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the odd chance which
had induced two boys to stroll, in the middle
of winter, along the bank of an insignificant
outlet of a Thames backwater, what a fine
place, I told myself, this would have been for
the concealment of a crime! Even without the
weights, which had probably become detached
from the sack by tangling among the roots
under the surface of the water, the body might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
have been expected to remain hidden for
months&#8211;at least, till the coming of the spring.</p>

<p>Then, as I so reflected, my mind turned to
darker thoughts. Had a crime been committed
by the inhabitants of the House by the
Lock, what a convenient hiding-place would
that adjacent waterway have been! I had
no reason to fancy that such a crime had been
done, and yet&#8211;my thoughts went back to the
day on which I paid my somewhat memorable
visit to Wildred and Farnham.</p>

<p>Suddenly came the recollection of the awful
cry I had heard as I waited in the curious octagonal
room, looking at the covered portrait
of Karine. The sound had been explained,
but there had been a certain flurry and clumsiness
in the explanation, I had thought, even
then.</p>

<p>I remembered the smoke and sparks which
had so mysteriously risen from the tower, and
the heat of the octagonal room adjoining it.
All this, too, had been accounted for. I had
not cared at the time to invent romances to fit
into the strange appearances, which I had assured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
myself were doubtless strange only in
appearance; but now I could not help dwelling
upon them with an almost morbid persistency
that would not be set aside.</p>

<p>I thought of the woman's face which had for
an instant gazed at me through the narrow
window beside the door. I reminded myself
of the surprise on the features of the decorous
male factotum when he had learned that I was
not the man expected by his master, and I
went over word for word, as nearly as I could,
each sentence whispered by Wildred and his
servant in the hall.</p>

<p>What if there were some ghastly connection
between the apparent mystery in the House
by the Lock and the half-charred, headless
body found to-day in the Thames!</p>

<p>I was ready to accuse my own enmity towards
Wildred, and my vague suspicions of
him, also my merciless desire to fasten some
stigma upon the man, of being potent factors
in these mental suggestions of mine.</p>

<p>But I could not banish them even if I would.
Continually throughout the remainder of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
evening and night I pieced together various
theories, all more or less defective, and next
morning the desire was strong within me to go
and see the headless corpse.</p>

<p>There were at least twenty chances to one
against my being able to identify it, or finding
in the pitiful remains of a tragedy any clue
such as I sought. But strange fancies steeped
my brain with their potent fumes, and I knew
that I should not be able to rest until, at least,
I had absolutely proved myself mistaken.</p>

<p>Permission to view the body at the mortuary
was easily obtained at the local police station,
when I had given my name, and mentioned
that I had come for purposes of identification.</p>

<p>Fortunately for my self-control, I had
looked upon many a gruesome sight during my
somewhat chequered career, though scarcely
one more hideous than this which I had deliberately
sought.</p>

<p>It would be worse than useless to enter into
a detailed description of what my eyes turned
from with loathing. There was only one possible
way of identification, however, that of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
finding some mark upon the partially charred
body, or <i>something lacking</i> which might be
suggestive of a theory.</p>

<p>I had a theory, which as yet I had scarcely
dared dwell upon in my own mind, so wild, so
improbable did it appear at any other time than
dead of night, when all strange things seem
possible. But now, as I judged what the
height and size of the body must have been,
and let my glance travel almost fearfully to
the left hand, I saw that which tended in a
ghastly manner to confirm it. All the four
fingers were missing, having been cut off between
the second joint and knuckles.</p>

<p>Harvey Farnham had worn the ring given
to Karine Cunningham by Wildred on the
little finger of the left hand; and in the light
of this discovery my dream of Christmas Eve
came back to me as a prophetic vision.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>Information Laid by Carson Wildred</span></h2>

<p>The case being one of great local importance,
having thrown the countryside into a
whirl of excitement, the inspector himself had
thought it worth while to accompany me on my
journey to the mortuary. My name was familiar
to him, he said, with a look of interest
and curiosity in his eyes; and this being so,
doubtless he had not been averse to the chance
of keeping watch upon me when I went to
gaze upon the body of the mysteriously murdered
man.</p>

<p>If he were interested in me, I was, at least,
equally interested in him, or rather in the
opinions which he and brother members of the
police force might have formed.</p>

<p>Reticence was, of course, supposed to be observed
by so important a functionary as the
inspector, but I saw that in his round, good-natured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
face which caused me to hope he
might be amenable to a little judiciously applied
flattery. I therefore extolled the arrangements
of the local authorities, and ended
by saying that, as the sight I had just witnessed
had considerably upset me, I should be
glad if he would do me the favour of having
something with me at the private bar of the
adjacent inn.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it's against the rules, you know,"
he said, smiling sapiently. "But I certainly
consider it an honour to be invited by so celebrated
a gentleman as you, Mr. Stanton. And&#8211;if
you'll go first, sir, I'll just look in a little
later and find you at the private bar."</p>

<p>I followed the prudent suggestion, and was
presently joined by the inspector, who appeared
relieved at finding himself shut in and
alone with me.</p>

<p>We had whisky and soda <i>ad libitum</i>, and
then I cautiously began: "The fact is, inspector,"
I said, "I was particularly anxious for
this chance of a little friendly chat with you.
I have certain suspicions which may be, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
course, without a grain of foundation. What
I mean to say is, I have grave fears that the
murdered man is the friend I thought it possible
I might identify. Who the murderer
may be in any case remains to be seen, but if
the body is that of the person I have in my
mind, I might be able to put a clue into the
hands of the police. 'A word to the wise,' you
know, inspector! But first I am hoping for
a little help from you before I run the risk of
incriminating one who may be innocent. Quite
between ourselves, allow me to ask what your
police surgeon has had to say regarding his
examination?"</p>

<p>The inspector looked dubious, then brightened
visibly. "You being the man you are,
Mr. Stanton," he said, sociably, over his third
glass of old Scotch, "I can't see that there'd
be anything amiss in my answering you so far.
Our surgeon, Mr. Potter, reported that the
corpse was that of a well-nourished man of
somewhere between forty and forty-five years
of age, all the organs healthy, though there
were traces of opium in the system&#8211;not, however,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
enough to have caused death. The head
had been severed from the neck by a skilled
anatomist, who knew exactly where to strike;
but it had been separated after death, not before.
Also the mutilation of the left hand
had been done in the same way. I suppose
that is roughly the sort of thing you wanted to
know?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," I returned, "and every detail
you have mentioned goes to strengthen my suspicions.
Being an amateur, I was obliged to
judge principally by size and height. The surgeon's
report fits in with my theory precisely.
Still, it does not comprise everything. It
would be a great assistance if I might know
whether the police have yet had any reliable information
to work upon."</p>

<p>We had grown very friendly, indeed, almost
fraternal now, and the inspector kindly allowed
me to refill his glass. "Do you know
who Mr. Carson Wildred, of the House by the
Lock, is, Mr. Stanton?" he enquired, confidentially.</p>

<p>The question surprised and excited me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
Was it possible, I hastily asked myself, that
already the police were on the same track that
I was following? If so, Wildred must have
shown himself a less impenetrable villain than
I had had reason to suppose him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I not only know who he is, but have
a slight personal acquaintance with him," I
said conservatively.</p>

<p>"Well, sir"&#8211;slowly, and with some unction&#8211;"Mr.
Wildred has been the only one so
far&#8211;not counting what you yourself may
have to say presently&#8211;who has given any information
of value."</p>

<p>"Indeed? <i>He</i> has given information?" I
could not eliminate the astonishment, and perhaps
something of the disappointment, from
my voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. As you know Mr. Wildred,
you're probably aware that his country house
is close by our town, and close, too, to the spot
where the body was found. He was in yesterday
evening, as soon as the matter had got
noised about, and asked to see the body."</p>

<p>"Incredible!" The word sprang to my lips,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
but I forced it back, and refrained from uttering
it.</p>

<p>"He was unable to identify it, but he spoke
to having seen something in the neighbourhood
of the small backwater not far from his
house, just before Christmas, which seemed
likely to throw light on the matter. The surgeon's
idea is, as I think I forgot to mention,
sir, that the body had been in the water since
Christmas time, or thereabouts, which made
Mr. Wildred's supposition the more feasible.</p>

<p>"It seems that the gentleman had a friend
staying with him at the House by the Lock
until a week or so ago&#8211;a Mr. Farnham, an
American&#8211;who has since sailed for home.
They were in the habit of taking a daily walk
together, whenever they were not in town, and
a week before Christmas noticed that close to
the little backwater two men were living in a
tent.</p>

<p>"It was a quiet place enough in winter
time, and the fellows might have expected to
escape observation, perhaps, but it was the
smell of their smoke which first attracted Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
Wildred and his friend to the spot, and as it
was his land Mr. Wildred at first was inclined
to order the chaps away. He thought better
of it, though, as he seems a good-natured gentleman,
and said it didn't really matter to him
whether they stayed or went. A strict watch
was kept on all the locks up at the house, however,
as it occurred to Mr. Wildred the men
might have some queer design. A day or two
went by, and the tent was still there, but on
Christmas, when Mr. Wildred and Mr. Farnham
were walking out, they heard the sound
of loud voices, and went near enough to see
that the two men were quarrelling outside.</p>

<p>"He says he wishes now he had interfered,
but it didn't seem worth while at the time.
That night there was an unpleasant smell of
burning, which came up to the House by the
Lock, with the wind from that quarter, and
was noticed by all the servants, as well as Mr.
Wildred, who asked the butler about it at dinner.
Next day, when Mr. Wildred sent down
to find out, the tent and the men were both
gone."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>"I suppose," I said, "that you have already
taken means to ascertain whether there are any
remaining traces of such an encampment by
the backwater?"</p>

<p>"Certainly we have. That was done immediately,
sir, and the ashes left by a big wood
fire were found close to the water; also four
rough stakes for the tent ropes, and&#8211;a coal
sack&#8211;much of the sort in which the body up
there at the mortuary was sewn. There was
something else, too, sir. I wouldn't mention
it thus early in the proceedings to anybody for
whom I hadn't the respect I have for you; but
even as it is, I must have your promise it
shan't go any further till it comes out in the
proper course of events."</p>

<p>I gave him my promise, hiding my impatience
as best I could.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Stanton," the inspector went
on, lowering his voice, though there was nobody
within earshot, "in the wood ashes was
found what looks like a most important clue.
Nothing less, sir, than the calcined bones of
four human fingers, <i>cut from the left hand</i>!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>"By Jove!" I ejaculated involuntarily,
springing to my feet, and beginning to walk
nervously up and down. I hardly knew
whether to feel that I had been brought to a
dead stop in my operations and suspicions, or
to tell myself that Carson Wildred was the
most cold-blooded, and, at the same time, the
cleverest scoundrel who had ever walked
the earth.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A Disappointment</span></h2>

<p>"You seem surprised, Mr. Stanton!" exclaimed
the inspector.</p>

<p>"I am surprised," I echoed, "and I intend
to explain why presently. Meanwhile, I suppose
you are trying to get on the track of the
second man who lived in that tent?"</p>

<p>"That's what we are doing, sir&#8211;hard at it."</p>

<p>"You will never find him," I said.</p>

<p>"No, sir? May I ask what makes you so
sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Simply because my opinion is that he does
not exist&#8211;never did exist."</p>

<p>The inspector's jaw dropped. "But&#8211;but
Mr. Carson Wildred&#8213;" he began, when I
turned on him and cut him short.</p>

<p>"Did your experience never show you a case
where a man, himself a criminal, invented
proofs and clues for the purpose of putting the
police upon the wrong track?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>He too started from his chair, forgetting to
set down his glass of whisky. "Good heavens,
sir, you don't mean to accuse&#8213;"</p>

<p>"I don't accuse. I am not yet in a position
to do that. I only suggest, and should be myself
a criminal if I did not try to throw such
light upon the matter as I can. Sit down
again, inspector, and let me tell you what I
know, and what I suspect."</p>

<p>He sat, or rather dropped into his lately-deserted
chair, and his horrified expression, his
drooping attitude, went far towards showing
me what an exalted position Carson Wildred
occupied in the esteem of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"I can't seem to realise it, Mr. Stanton,"
ejaculated the inspector. "Such a man as
Mr. Wildred! So respected, so charitable, has
given so much to the church! Why, you must
be making a mistake."</p>

<p>"You shall judge for yourself whether I
have any evidence to offer worth building
upon," I returned. And then I told him everything,
beginning with my chance meeting with
Harvey Farnham at the theatre on Christmas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
Eve. His face grew graver and graver as I
went on, and when at last (having dwelt with
due insistence upon the mysterious proceedings
attending my call at the House by the Lock) I
mentioned the reappearance of the ring on "a
young lady's finger," he shook his head regretfully.</p>

<p>"You've made out a fairly good case against
Mr. Wildred, sir," he observed. "Would it
be indiscreet to ask whether you've any <i>personal</i>
enmity against the gentleman?"</p>

<p>"I don't like him," I admitted. And then
I went on to describe in a few words my haunting
impression of having been disagreeably
associated with him in the past.</p>

<p>"I would wish," I added hurriedly, "to keep
the name of the lady now in possession of the
ring entirely out of the question if possible.
It must only be brought in, inspector, at the
last extremity should no other means remain of
detecting a murderer. As for the ring itself,
to save trouble in that direction, I think I could
if necessary engage to get hold of it, and I am
quite ready at any time to swear to its identity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
with the one worn by my old friend Farnham."</p>

<p>The inspector thoughtfully scratched his
head. "It'll be a nasty business to examine
Mr. Wildred's house, in case your friend Mr.
Farnham should prove to be all right over in
the States. But we can't lose any time.
What you've told me to-day is very serious, sir,
and must be attended to at once. A couple of
detectives will call at the House by the Lock
with a search-warrant before nightfall. I can
assure you of that. Until some definite conclusion
is arrived at, Mr. Stanton, I suppose
you would prefer that your name didn't appear
in the matter?"</p>

<p>"I don't care a hang whether it appears or
not," I retorted recklessly. Perhaps if I had
been a little less reckless&#8211;but it is never profitable
to dwell on and brood over the mistakes of
one's past.</p>

<p>The inspector assured me that a detective
should call that night at the hotel in Great
Marlow where I had volunteered to remain,
and give me all particulars concerning the examination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
of the House by the Lock. The
appointment made was for eight o'clock, by
which time, allowing for obstacles and unforeseen
delays, all was sure to be well over.</p>

<p>Though the inspector had promised that the
New York police should be communicated
with, a great restlessness was upon me, and I
resolved myself to cable to America.</p>

<p>It was possible that the <i>St. Paul</i>, the ship in
which Farnham had been supposed to sail, was
arriving at New York that day, though the
chances were, as the weather had been rough,
that she would not have made one of her record
trips. However, there could be no harm
in wiring, and if the ship had got in all waste
of time would be avoided.</p>

<p>I wrote out a despatch to the office of the
American line in New York, to be answered
(reply prepaid) the moment the <i>St. Paul</i> got
in. In this I enquired whether Mr. Harvey
Farnham, of Denver, Colorado, had been
among the passengers. And not contenting
myself with this I cabled Farnham, both to
Denver and New York, and to the manager
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
of the Fifth Avenue Hotel in the latter place,
where I had been told that he usually put up.</p>

<p>The answers to these messages I requested
to have sent me at the hotel I had chosen for
my headquarters in Great Marlow.</p>

<p>The hours which must intervene before I
could possibly hope for a return I spent at the
Wayfarers', and there I heard of Wildred, who
had lunched at the club with his friend Wigram,
and later had been interrupted during a
game of billiards by a telegram. He had used
some strong language, and hurriedly excusing
himself, had left in the midst of the game.</p>

<p>Things had evidently been put into train
early, I told myself with satisfaction, and I
concluded that the despatch had either gone out
from police headquarters or been sent by that
stealthy-faced, invaluable major-domo of
Wildred's.</p>

<p>By half-past five I was in the train again,
carrying with me all that I could want for the
stay of a day or two in a strange hotel, and
before eight o'clock I had dined and was
anxiously awaiting the appearance of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
detective. I had hardly dared to hope as yet for
any answer to my cablegrams, still I was disappointed
to find upon my advent in Great Marlow
that nothing had arrived.</p>

<p>Every step along the corridor outside the
private sitting-room I had taken made me start
like a nervous woman, fancying each time that
a knock on my door might follow and the
wished-for message be handed in to me.</p>

<p>I did not believe that I should hear from
Farnham, because my conviction was steadily
growing that his murdered body lay unidentified
in the mortuary not far away. But I did
expect to hear from the ship's company to the
effect that no such passenger had been on
board the <i>St. Paul</i>. Should this intelligence
arrive, there would be so great an increase of
the circumstantial evidence against Wildred
that I believed the police would be justified in
making an arrest. Wildred once arrested and
obliged to stand his trial for the crime of murder,
Karine Cunningham would be saved.</p>

<p>Eight o'clock struck, however, and I was reluctantly
obliged to give up all idea of receiving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
any news from America for the night.
Five minutes later, as I restlessly paced the
room, the wished-for knock sounded, but there
was no cablegram to be presented on a tray. A
young, fresh-faced man in plain clothing stood
there, who I knew before he spoke must be the
expected detective. His information might
prove of equal importance with the tidings
from America, and I received him cordially.</p>

<p>With his first words, however, my heart went
down like lead. It was not that I was eager
to see a presumably innocent man proved a
murderer for the sake of my own selfish ends,
but thoroughly believing Wildred to be a consummate
scoundrel, I was anxious that he
should be found out in time to prevent disaster.</p>

<p>"I think sir," said the young man of the
cheerful countenance, "that we've been on a
false scent to-day."</p>

<p>I got him to sit down, and launched him
upon the full tide of narrative.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wildred was away when we first arrived
at the House by the Lock, sir," he went
on, "but we should have made use of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
search-warrant without waiting for his return
had not the passage and the octagonal room
you described, as well as the tower, been shut
off from all communication with the older part
of the house by a heavy iron door, of which
Mr. Wildred invariably carries the key. This
his butler explained by saying that the door had
been placed on account of his master's chemical
experiments, which were sometimes of a
slightly dangerous character, unless great precautions
were used, and in case of an explosion
or other accident the safety of the living-rooms
might be assured by means of the iron door.
The only way of opening it would have been to
employ dynamite, the lock being impregnable;
and as the grounds for suspicion against Mr.
Wildred were not yet strong enough to resort
to such violent means, there was nothing to do
but wait. He was wired for to London at
once."</p>

<p>"Naturally he would prefer being on the
spot," I said, with something like a sneer. "All
the same, I am very sure that there <i>is</i> another
means of communicating with the octagonal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
room and the tower besides the main door
through the passage." And I mentioned the
mysterious disappearance of the servant, which
had on Christmas Day led me to believe in the
existence of a secret way of exit.</p>

<p>"We did look about for something of the
sort, and even went down a cellar," said the
detective, "but saw not the slightest sign to
suggest a hidden door."</p>

<p>"Well, go on then to Mr. Wildred's return,"
I exclaimed impatiently. "I am anxious
to learn why it has been decided that I
put you on the wrong track."</p>

<p>"When he came home he admitted very
frankly that he had been annoyed at the bother
occasioned by our telegram, but appeared by
that time to have recovered from his vexation,
and to be inclined to laugh the matter off. He
let us know in a moment that he guessed how
the information had come, but we said nothing,
of course, to confirm his suppositions.</p>

<p>"In the first place he opened the iron door,
explained its workings as though he took some
pride in its mechanism, which he said he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
invented himself. Then he showed us into the
octagonal room, which he had had fitted up as
a studio and smoking-room combined. The
little door you had seen behind the drapery
merely led into a cupboard containing boots,
an artist's model&#8211;a jointed figure of wood&#8211;and
other odds and ends. It was concealed
only because it was not 'an object of beauty,'
Mr. Wildred said.</p>

<p>"We then proceeded to the tower, where the
chemical experiments are made. There is a
small room, reached by mounting a winding
skeleton stairway of iron, and there we were
shown Mr. Wildred's apparatus. I know
something of chemistry myself, having had a
fad that way when I was a boy, and I could see
that everything he had was straight and above-board.
A big fireplace in the room accounts for
the sparks you saw when you approached the
house that day, and Mr. Wildred voluntarily
mentioned that there had been something
wrong with the flues, so that his experiments
could not be conducted properly, and he had
sent for an expert to come down from London
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
to look at everything. The man had been expected
on Christmas Eve, then on Christmas, as
Mr. Wildred considered the matter urgent, and
finally arrived the day after. Mr. Wildred
gave us his address without waiting to be asked
to do so. That accounted for one more point
in your story, sir&#8211;the man who was so anxiously
looked for, the man the butler seemed
at first to take you to be.</p>

<p>"We then said we had been informed that
screams or groans had been heard issuing from
his house on Christmas Day. Mr. Wildred
laughed, remarking that, judging from what
he knew of our informant, he had been waiting
for us to come to that point.</p>

<p>"And he repeated the explanation which
had been given you, asking us also if we would
care to see the scar (which was not yet quite
healed) made by the burning methylated spirit
on the cook's foot or ankle.</p>

<p>"We thought it best to do as he suggested&#8211;indeed,
if he had not, we should have proposed
the same course ourselves, for the sake of making
assurance doubly sure. The cook was sent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
for, a very handsome young woman, sir, bright
and ready with her answers. She described
the accident, and whipping off the shoe and
stocking from the right foot, showed us a red
mark which spread from the ankle down over
the whole instep."</p>

<p>"So the cook was a handsome young woman,
was she?" I asked, suspiciously, remembering
the face which had peered at me through the
narrow window by the door. "Had she great
black eyes, a very white face, and a quantity
of dark hair?"</p>

<p>"She had, sir. That would describe her
very well. A woman not more than twenty-five
or six, and evidently of a superior class."</p>

<p>I turned this bit of information over in my
mind. To be sure, I could not at the moment
make anything of it apropos of the case in
hand, but afterwards I was to remember it
under somewhat startling circumstances.</p>

<p>"So you see, sir," the detective continued,
"every point you made was met, and in our
opinion, frankly and sufficiently met. Nothing
was found which could possibly justify an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
arrest, and unless unfavourable reports are received
from the New York police, the case
against Mr. Wildred will have to be dropped.
The inspector is having an interview with him
to-night, and doubtless some details with which
we, in enforcing our search-warrant, had no
concern will be satisfactorily cleared up. I
mean to say, details relating to the American
gentleman, his ring, and his departure for the
States. Should we hear from New York that
he has not returned, why of course, in spite of
appearances at the House by the Lock and
failure of circumstantial evidence, suspicion
will be renewed again."</p>

<p>There was absolutely nothing more to be
said. Deep as was my chagrin, I held my
tongue as to my opinion of the way affairs had
been managed, and parted with the young
detective with apparent nonchalance.</p>

<p>Naturally, I slept little during the night, and
was awake even before the early knock which
sounded at my door.</p>

<p>"Two cablegrams for you, sir," said the
waiter, when I had bidden him come in.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A Desperate Remedy</span></h2>

<p>I took the envelopes from the man and told
him he might go. Now for it! I thought.
Now to see whether the edifice I had builded
had but a foundation of sand, or whether Wildred
had merely been clever enough to pull
wool over the eyes of the police.</p>

<p>My heart was thumping with excitement as
I opened the first envelope.</p>

<p>"<i>St. Paul</i> in to-night. First-class passenger
on board named Harvey Farnham."</p>

<p>I laid the bit of paper down dazedly and
took up the other. It was from the manager
of the Fifth Avenue Hotel, in New York.
"Mr. Farnham telegraphed to keep room for
him. Is spending day or two with friends."</p>

<p>I did not know what to think. It all sounded
straightforward enough, and it was not credible
that either the official in the office of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
American liners, or the manager of an hotel,
could be in collusion with Carson Wildred.
Still, I was far from being satisfied.</p>

<p>For the moment I had done all that I could
do. If Farnham was stopping with a friend,
whose address was unknown to me, I could not
at present expect to receive an answer either to
my New York or Denver cable. In a day or
two the police would hear something from the
other side, and meanwhile I must possess my
soul in patience.</p>

<p>This was a thing easier said than done, especially
as, when aimlessly glancing at a weekly
paper in the club next day, I came across a
paragraph which gushed in the conventionally
nauseous manner over the forthcoming marriage
of the beautiful young heiress, Miss
Karine Cunningham, and Mr. Carson Wildred,
the "well-known millionaire and popular
man of Society."</p>

<p>Days never dragged as they did with me
until I received the promised intimation from
my friend the inspector that tidings had arrived
from the police in New York. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
all right, so far as my friend was concerned,
and I need have no further fears regarding his
safety. The body found in the Thames was
certainly not that of Mr. Harvey Farnham,
as he was in New York, and had actually been
interviewed there. He had been very ill in
crossing, and had had the misfortune to fall
down the companionway on shipboard, in a
heavy gale, spraining his ankle. He would
not be able to resume his journey and proceed
to Denver for some time to come, but had
laughed at the idea of any foul play. When
questioned on the subject of the ring, he said
that he had given it to his friend, Mr. Wildred,
at parting, and jokingly added that he had
experienced great difficulty in getting it
off.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, as there could be no
further doubt of Mr. Farnham's living presence
in New York, no possible shadow of suspicion
need any longer rest upon Mr. Carson
Wildred, who had throughout done all in his
power to further the investigations. The
search for the man from the camp near the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
backwater would therefore be carried on upon
the same lines as before.</p>

<p>A hot sense of injustice burned within me.
I had been thwarted on every side, not, I believed,
by the revelation of truth, but by
Carson Wildred's superior cunning. He had
boasted to me that, in the <i>rôle</i> of villain,
he would have been more successful than
I; and I was quite ready to agree with
this statement. All things seemed against me,
and yet something which I took to be instinct
cried aloud that my dream had not deceived.
I could not understand how it was that the
New York police had been made to believe in
the identity of a man falsely representing himself
to be Harvey Farnham, yet I was convinced
that in some devilish way even they had
been cozened. No other man living, perhaps,
could have undertaken so huge a scheme, with
so many different strings to pull at one and
the same time, and successfully carry it
through, save Carson Wildred. But Carson
Wildred <i>had</i> attempted it, I concluded, and
having gone so far, there was every reason to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
suppose he would triumph if I&#8211;who alone of
all men seemed personally interested&#8211;did not
set myself to the finding of a new method for
blocking his game.</p>

<p>I could, I thought, understand what his
motive for so foul a murder might have been.
He had just purchased a valuable gold mine
from Farnham. Should Farnham be made to
vanish without fear of suspicion falling upon
Wildred, the latter might not only be the owner
of the mine, but repossess himself of the purchase-money,
which must have comprised a
very large sum.</p>

<p>There was no further hope from the police.
They had done their duty, had satisfied themselves
on every point, and it would have been
unjust to expect that they should continue to
exert themselves in favouring my apparently
wild view of the situation.</p>

<p>In the midst of the cogitations which followed
upon the receipt of the inspector's letter
another cablegram was handed in to me. This
time it purported to be from Farnham himself,
merely saying, "Many thanks for kind enquiries.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
Have turned up here smiling, but too
seedy to write at present. Glad to hear from
you.&#8211;Fifth Avenue Hotel."</p>

<p>One more blow aimed at my theory! But I
refused to be knocked down by it. For
Karine's sake, for my own sake, I would follow
my convictions across the sea, and never
rest until I had settled all doubts for myself.</p>

<p>It was then Friday. In five minutes after
reading this third and apparently conclusive
cablegram I had resolved that on the following
day, Saturday, I would sail for New York.</p>

<p>It was only by a severe mental wrench that I
arrived at this almost desperate decision, for I
stood between two fires, either one of which
might reduce my hopes to ashes.</p>

<p>Going to America meant leaving Karine
Cunningham, at this critical juncture, to the
mercy of the enemy. I had offered her friendship,
and such protection as I could give,
against those who were bent on forcing her
inclinations; and with a look in her sweet eyes,
and a soft quiver in her voice which I could
never forget, she had asked me "not to go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
away." If I went, and any harm should come
to her during my absence, I could never forgive
myself, never again know a moment's
peace of mind. And yet&#8211;if I stayed, what
was there to hope for either of us? I had shot
all my arrows, and they had glanced off,
blunted, from Wildred's apparently invulnerable
armour. I had lost the chance of gaining
assistance from the police, so far as I could
see, and unless some miracle should suddenly
come to pass, I should be obliged to stand by
while Karine Cunningham gave her unwilling
self to Wildred.</p>

<p>Whatever her secret reason for consenting
to do so might be, she had plainly let me understand
that she meant to marry the man, unless
Fate especially intervened in her behalf.</p>

<p>There was no hope that she would let me
save her by carrying her away. I had not
even the slightest reason to suppose that she
cared for me, save as a friend, in the midst of
what otherwise she had said would be friendlessness.</p>

<p>My hands were bound, therefore, so long as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
Carson Wildred was able to hold up his guilty
head before the world, and pass himself off as
a blameless member of society.</p>

<p>Between the horns of this dilemma&#8211;and
heaven knows they were both sharp enough&#8211;I
could only choose the one on which Karine
and I seemed less likely to be torn; and therefore
it was that I elected to go to America.</p>

<p>I did not feel that I could bear to leave without
a word to her. How could I tell in what
light my absence might be made to appear?
From the vague hints she had dropped as to
her relations with Sir Walter and Lady Tressidy,
I hardly considered that it would be safe
to write to her. Such a letter as I must send,
should I write at all, if read by eyes for which
it was not intended, might bring Karine into
serious trouble. It was true that Lady Tressidy
had appeared to be inclined towards
friendliness with me, but she had then no suspicions
of my attitude to Karine.</p>

<p>I would go down into the country and call
upon Lady Tressidy and Miss Cunningham, I
resolved; and if I had no opportunity of speaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
with my beautiful girl in private, I would
contrive to slip into her own hand a note previously
prepared.</p>

<p>My decisions, when made, are usually soon
acted upon. Within a couple of hours after
receiving the inspector's letter and the message
from New York my passage was engaged for
the following day. A curious mood was upon
me as I began my preparations. Hardly more
than a fortnight ago I had been congratulating
myself on the prospect of a considerable
stay in London. My ideal existence had for
the moment been an utterly aimless one. I
was sated with excitement and what is popularly
called "adventure," and had only wanted
to rest and amuse myself. I had meant to be
a man about town until I should again tire of
the life, drifting agreeably here and there, taking
pleasure as it came, troubling myself little
either about other people's affairs or my
own.</p>

<p>And this was the result of my plan. There
seemed a certain unreality about it all. I felt
like the puppet of circumstances, or one who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
moved through strange mazes, half conscious
that he merely dreams.</p>

<p>By two o'clock everything was arranged for
my departure on Saturday, and I was at
Waterloo, taking my ticket for Haslemere,
which was the station nearest to Sir Walter
Tressidy's country place.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>"Not at Home"</span></h2>

<p>I had a long, dreary drive after leaving the
train, though in other circumstances I might
have been charmed with the loveliness of one
of England's fairest counties. As it was I
merely chafed at the endless hill, up which the
horse slowly plodded, half inclined to think that
after all I should have done better to trust to
my own feet or come on a bicycle from town.</p>

<p>The curtain of twilight was falling by the
time my fly entered the long avenue that led to
the house. Here and there lights shone out
from the windows, and as the vehicle drew up
before the door I caught a glimpse of something
which set my heart throbbing.</p>

<p>It was only a ruddy gleam of firelight on a
golden head, which shone for an instant in the
warm light like burnished copper; only a rosy
glow on a girl's white dress, a shimmer seen between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
the parted folds of dark, rich window
drapings.</p>

<p>For a second, no more, the vision was
granted me. A tall, slender form rose from
its kneeling position before the fire, and in so
moving passed beyond my line of sight. But
my pulses leaped, and I rejoiced in the good
fortune which had brought me at an hour when
Karine was not absent.</p>

<p>I stepped quickly from the cab and would
have given much for the right of a greater intimacy&#8211;a
right to go to the window and
knock, begging the girl I loved to let me in,
to grant me the heaven of ten minutes alone
with her, before the necessities of convention
called upon me to ask for Lady Tressidy.</p>

<p>I imagined what it would be to have this
right; I pictured myself tapping at the panes
of the long French window, I saw the dainty
girlish form coming toward me, the start of
surprise, the flush which I might read as I
would, the raising of the latch, and the two
warm little hands held out to me in welcome.</p>

<p>But it was all a dream, vanishing as quickly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
as the rainbow colours in a bubble, and leaving
only the darkness of the dull winter twilight
behind. Such privileges were for a happier
man than I: I was at best only her "friend."
Never could I hope, whether success or failure
crowned the effort I was impatient to begin&#8211;for
more than that.</p>

<p>Instead I walked soberly up to the door and
knocked, telling the cabman that he might
wait&#8211;and wishing that he might have to wait
for long.</p>

<p>Presently in answer to my summons a footman
appeared (a fellow I remembered to have
seen at the town house when I had called), and
it struck me that, as I enquired if Lady Tressidy
was at home, he eyed me more piercingly
than a well-trained servant usually eyes a
guest.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir," he answered with a slight
hesitation, "that her ladyship is out at present.
What name shall I say when she returns?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Stanton," I unsuspectingly replied,
though it did dimly occur to me that the man
might have left me to give him my card. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
seemed almost too good to be true that Lady
Tressidy should be away from home, for now I
felt practically certain that I should have the
unexpected joy of seeing Karine alone, speaking
to her far more unrestrainedly than I could
do in the presence of her hostess, and explaining
in a way satisfactory to us both, my intended
absence.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," I hypocritically remarked,
"not to see Lady Tressidy; but I have come
some distance, and perhaps Miss Cunningham
would spare me a few minutes."</p>

<p>"I&#8211;I am afraid, sir"&#8211;still stammering
uncomfortably&#8211;"that Miss Cunningham is
away with her ladyship."</p>

<p>I was astonished at this piece of information,
for I was absolutely sure that it was
Karine whose shining halo of hair and white
gown I had seen in that rosy space between the
window curtains. Of course the footman
might honestly believe that she was not at
home; but I did not mean lightly to abandon
the chance of a few words with her.</p>

<p>"I think you are mistaken about that," I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
boldly said. "Please be good enough at any
rate to enquire."</p>

<p>The fellow's face reddened, contrasting unpleasantly
with his powder, but he persisted in
his story.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure I am right, sir," he went
on more firmly. "Miss Cunningham is with
my lady."</p>

<p>My impulse was to slip a couple of sovereigns
into his palm, and insist that he should
ascertain if Miss Cunningham were not after
all at home, for I was beginning to be suspicious
of a plot to thwart me. If such an one
existed I could not think that Karine had been
a party to it, for though of course she could
not care to see me, in at all the same way in
which I yearned for a sight of her sweet face,
I believed that she would not wish me to be
sent away from the house humiliated. My
hand was moving toward my pocket, when suddenly
I reconsidered. If I took such strong
measures to secure a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Karine, it
might appear that we were in collusion, and
trouble thus be made for her with Lady Tressidy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
and Sir Walter. I could not risk causing
her uneasiness, especially as I was going far
away; and with a pang I saw that I was in a
trap.</p>

<p>There might be one way out, however, and I
took it.</p>

<p>"I will wait," I announced, "until the ladies
return. Or possibly Sir Walter&#8213;"</p>

<p>"Sir Walter won't be here for a day or
two," promptly responded the man.</p>

<p>So thoroughly miserable did he look, though
his manner gained confidence, that I thought
he must still be new to a service which must
foster a certain amount of conventional deceit.</p>

<p>"As for the ladies, sir, unfortunately they
are not expected back this evening until&#8211;until
the last train&#8211;too late, as you can understand,
sir, to receive any visitors, as at all events they
can't reach the house until after eleven."</p>

<p>I bit my lip with futile indignation against
Lady Tressidy, and against Fate&#8211;never
against Karine. It was evident that the footman
had received the most stringent orders as
to what he must do in case of so undesirable an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
emergency as a visit from Mr. Noel Stanton.
He had probably been asked if he was certain
of being able to recognise me again, had
answered that he believed he would be so, but
on suddenly being called upon to face the responsibility,
had made his little bid for ascertaining
my name as early as possible in the
game, by way of rendering assurance doubly
sure.</p>

<p>Of course the dutiful servant was not really
to blame for following out his instructions to
the letter, yet I felt that I hated his smug face
and plastered head, and would have liked to
frighten him with menaces and strange foreign
oaths.</p>

<p>I dared not give him the note which I had
written, meaning if necessary to slip it into
Karine's own hand unseen, for it might easily
be that, despite any bribe I offered, it would
never reach the dear eyes for which it was intended.</p>

<p>"I will write a line on my card, then, to be
handed to the ladies, whom I regret not having
seen," I said with what dignity I had at my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
command. And stepping past him into the
hall, despite a visible gleam of consternation in
his eye, I deliberately took out a pencil and
card-case, slowly scribbling a few words.</p>

<p>My hope was that if Karine was really in the
drawing-room she would come forth, and the
Gordian knot of the dilemma would be cut.</p>

<p>But having mentioned my imminent departure
from England on private and urgent business,
and added that, though I had been
anxious to see Lady Tressidy and Miss Cunningham
for the sake of bidding good-bye, it
would be, more strictly speaking, only <i>au
revoir</i>, as I intended returning within the next
four weeks, I could think of nothing more to
say. And still the drawing-room door, near
which I was standing, was not opened.</p>

<p>I should have been glad to underscore the
last six words, but did not venture to do so for
obvious reasons, and could only hope that
Karine might see them or hear them read, and
partly understand.</p>

<p>I conspicuously placed a sovereign on the
card as I gave it to the footman, remarking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
quietly that I would wish the latter to be delivered
in the presence of both ladies if possible.
Then I seemed to have come to the end
of my resources, until a desperate idea seized
me.</p>

<p>Had I not been virtually certain that Karine
was to be kept from seeing me, without her
own consent to such an arrangement, naturally
I would have accepted my <i>congé</i> with a good
grace, and gone away, a wiser as well as a sadder
man; but as it was, and considering the
importance for her future as well as my own,
of a hasty explanation between us, I was ready
to snatch at almost any expedient, not prejudicial
to her, of obtaining a word with Karine
Cunningham.</p>

<p>I turned from the door and got into the cab,
which the footman politely opened for me as if
only too glad to speed the parting guest. The
direction, "to the station," was given, the
gravel crunched under the wheels and horse's
hoofs, the door at which I had been received so
inhospitably shut me out of paradise, and no
doubt the servant triumphantly watched me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
drive off. Half-way down the avenue, however,
I thrust my stick from the window of
the rattle-trap vehicle and stopped the coachman.</p>

<p>"I have forgotten something," I curtly said.
"You needn't go back; wait here, and I'll return
again in a few moments."</p>

<p>The fly was standing just out of sight from
the house, and rapidly leaving it behind me I
strode over the frozen grass of the lawn, taking
a shorter cut than the avenue would have
been.</p>

<p>In considerably less than five minutes I had
once more arrived in front of the window
through which I was as positive as ever I had
seen Karine. Only a short time ago I had
dreamed of doing such a thing as this as a
delicious impossibility, only belonging to a
world of romance which I could never enter.
But here I was actually bent on the accomplishment
of the deed.</p>

<p>The falling darkness had protected me, I
felt confident, from being seen by anybody in
the house as I crossed the lawn, and I approached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
with boldness, which only left me as
I reached the window.</p>

<p>The curtain hung apart as before, and I
could see the fireplace with the lights and
shadows travelling fantastically along the
polished floor and wall. The white irradiated
figure was no longer visible, but undiscouraged
by this fact I gently tapped, trusting that
Karine might be in another part of the room
to which my eyes could not reach.</p>

<p>If she were there my knock would startle
her perhaps, and she would draw near in
curiosity to see what had made the slight suspicious
noise; then I could make my presence
known, leaving apologies till later, and afterward&#8211;well,
afterward the rest must depend
upon her.</p>

<p>But I knocked once, twice, thrice, each time
a little louder, a little more insistently than before,
and there was no response, no sound, no
movement. After all I was thwarted, and had
but one comfort in the midst of gloom&#8211;I had
not been easily repulsed, I had done what I
could, and need not feel, when I was far away,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
that I had let myself be outwitted, outgeneralled,
without an effort to resist.</p>

<p>Fate had decided that I must go to America
without a word, without a look into Karine
Cunningham's eyes; and drearily returning to
my waiting cab I commenced once more the
tedious drive to the station.</p>

<p>Never had I felt more utterly disheartened;
for, after all, I could not be <i>quite</i> sure that
Karine had not acquiesced in the order to exclude
me from the house. It seemed that she
must have heard my voice in the hall, that if
she had chosen she might easily have contrived
some means of seeing me while I was briskly
taxing my ingenuity to reach her. I guessed
at Wildred's powerful influence in the affair,
and was ready to fancy others; but, as I was to
learn long afterward, I brought forward every
reason for Karine's mysterious inertness save
the right one.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>The Quest</span></h2>

<p>It was a piercingly cold day when I landed
in New York&#8211;such cold as I had not felt since
I had finished my last American visit, four
years ago.</p>

<p>Everyone else among the many first-class
passengers seemed to have some welcoming
friend to greet him on shore save only myself.
I would not let myself acknowledge that I felt
discouragement, but a certain gloomy sense of
the hopelessness of my undertaking would
obtrude itself, as I rattled over the badly-paved
streets of New York in the chill seclusion of
my cab.</p>

<p>I had myself driven straight to the Fifth
Avenue Hotel, which was becoming almost an
old-fashioned hostelry now among its many
tall new rivals of incredibly many storeys in
height, and walking up to the "office" prepared
my most affable manner, to win the confidence
of the smart "clerk" or book-keeper.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>"Good-day," I began agreeably, wishing
that in former visits to New York I had
stopped at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, so that
now, for my quest's sake, I should be accorded
the welcome of an old friend.</p>

<p>"Good-day," was the brisk reply. "You
want a room?"</p>

<p>"I should like first to enquire if Mr. Harvey
Farnham, of Denver, Colorado, is stopping
here," I said. "My principal object in choosing
this hotel was to meet him, but if&#8213;"</p>

<p>"Gone three days ago," broke in the gentleman
with the waxed moustache, who evidently
did not wish to waste time on a traveller more
inclined to parley than to patronise the
house.</p>

<p>This was the first setback I had experienced
on American shores, but so many had been my
portion on the other side of the Atlantic that
I had had time to grow accustomed to them.
I had prepared my mind for as numerous rebuffs
here, yet in spite of that I felt the bitterness
of disappointment settling bleakly down
upon me. Already I had been given a sign
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
that Wildred's cleverness had projected itself
across the width of ocean.</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed, I'm sorry to hear that he has
left. Is he with friends in town, or has he
gone to Denver?" I questioned, with as bland
an air as I could well command.</p>

<p>"Can't tell you whether he's gone to Denver,
I'm sure, sir. But I think it's almost certain
he's not in town, and somehow or other I've got
the impression that he mentioned he was going
west."</p>

<p>"I suppose his health improved more rapidly
than he expected, then," I went on. "I understood
before crossing that his accident on shipboard
had laid him up for awhile, and that it
would be some time before he felt fit to undertake
the journey home."</p>

<p>"He did seem rather seedy," vouchsafed the
clerk. "But he was pretty well able to take
care of himself. Shall I put you down for a
room?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered indifferently. "I suppose
you may as well&#8211;for one night."</p>

<p>It was already late in the afternoon, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
had certain investigations to make before I renewed
my interrupted journey in the direction
Harvey Farnham was believed to have taken&#8211;going
toward the setting sun.</p>

<p>I knew well enough that I was seriously
handicapped as a detective by my complete
amateurishness, and possibly a little by my own
keen personal anxiety, which did not tend to
cool my head or my pulses when coolness was
needed; but though I would fain have had advice
from some clever professional expert, the
reports of the New York police had certainly
not been such as would encourage me to seek
assistance from the force. It appeared to me
that I must "dree my weird" alone.</p>

<p>In the handsome, typically American room
that was allotted to me I sat down to map out
my future course, as well as I could see it.</p>

<p>Either the brisk-mannered young "clerk"
had shown a slight reserve in answering my
eager questions regarding Harvey Farnham,
or I had been morbidly sensitive enough to
fancy it in his face and way of speaking.
Doubtless, when the police had been acting in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
the affair under advices from London, he had
been subjected to a previous catechism concerning
the western millionaire's movements, and
if that were the case it was only natural he
should be cautiously inclined. But once I
could win his confidence and thoroughly convince
him that I had no connection whatever
with the police, I ventured to hope there might
yet be a chance of learning at least a little more
from him than I had been able to glean.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was something in the nature of a
sop to Cerberus that I should have asked for
one of the best rooms in the house; and then,
beside, my name written in the visitors' book
(or "hotel register," as it is the fashion to call
it in the States) evidently had some meaning
for the young man round whom my hopes centred,
for his manner had decidedly changed for
the better when I visited him again after
dinner.</p>

<p>He was not particularly busy at the moment,
and appeared in the humour for conversation,
asking me of his own free will if it were possible
that I was "Noel Stanton, the traveller."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>I did not deny this impeachment, and, moreover,
showed myself willing to be "drawn" on
the subject of my explorations. I even went
so far as to relate an adventure at some length
(a thing I am thankful to say I have never
been guilty of before or since), told an anecdote
which made the young man laugh, and
flattered him to the best of my ability, by asking
his opinion about an American political
crisis of the day. Then, by gradual steps, I
led the talk toward the great West in general,
Colorado silver mines in particular, and so at
last reached the subject of Harvey Farnham,
one of the most prominent of the financiers of
that State.</p>

<p>"I was much disappointed, I confess, at not
finding him here," I remarked, "and shall on
his account cut short my visit to New York.
Farnham and I have known each other for
some years; and, by the way, I remember his
saying that in his opinion this was the best-managed
hotel in New York. I believe he
usually stops here when in town, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"So it seems, sir," answered the clerk, very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
civilly now, having decided to be patient with
my humour. "However, I had never seen him
until he turned up the other day. I haven't
been in my present position very long."</p>

<p>"I suppose you did see him though?" I persevered.
"How was he looking after his accident&#8211;seedy
at all?"</p>

<p>"He was very <i>thin</i>, if you mean that,"
laughed my informant. "He limped about
with a crutch, too, and as he had bumped his
forehead in the same fall which sprained his
ankle, he wore a green shade that covered
his temples and his eyes." I grew attentive at
this. It appeared to me that here was a point
in my favour.</p>

<p>"I should like to have a talk with one of his
old friends in the hotel," I said; "the manager,
for instance. No doubt he knows Mr. Farnham
very well."</p>

<p>"He does, but he's out of town on business
for a day or two. I think you'll find, though,
that our bartender and Mr. Farnham were
about as chummy together as anyone in the
house."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>Apparently at my leisure, really with great
impatience, I repaired to the extremely handsome
"barroom" of the Fifth Avenue Hotel,
and here the oracle was very communicative.</p>

<p>Having mixed me a peculiarly American
drink called "gin fizz," the bartender was willing
to chat of Mr. Farnham.</p>

<p>"I guess he must have been pretty bad this
last time," he said, in response to my first
question, "for he didn't trouble the barroom
much."</p>

<p>"He did come in, however, did he not?" I
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he came in once or twice, but I
thought he acted rather grumpy and queer."</p>

<p>"Did you have a good look at him either
time?" I pressed on, with eagerness.</p>

<p>"Pretty good. Almost as close as you are
now, I guess."</p>

<p>"And did he appear the same as usual, with
the exception of the green shade over his
eyes?"</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon he did. I was kind of busy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
both times, and I don't know as I took much
notice."</p>

<p>"Still"&#8211;and I called up a laugh&#8211;"you'd
have known whether it really <i>was</i> Mr. Farnham,
or a stranger passing himself off in his
place?"</p>

<p>The bartender stared at me for an instant,
and, had he spoken his inmost thoughts, probably
they might have been appropriately expressed
in the slang phrase, "Ah, what are you
givin' me?" "Well, it might have been his
grandfather's ghost, I daresay," he facetiously
remarked at length, "but, anyhow, there
seemed to be a strong resemblance between
Harvey Farnham and him."</p>

<p>I set down my glass untouched. A cold
conviction was growing within me that I had
been mistaken; that, villain as Carson Wildred
was, he had not, after all, been guilty of the
one great crime which I had attributed to him.
It seemed almost impossible that this keen-eyed
man, accustomed to Farnham's comings
and goings for several years, could have mistaken
another for him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>Next morning when I had put together the
few things that I had had occasion to unpack,
and was "tipping" the pretty chambermaid
who "chanced" to come to my door as I was
departing, a sudden inspiration seized me, and
I called the young woman back again as she
was disappearing.</p>

<p>"By the way," I said, "did you happen to
attend a Mr. Harvey Farnham, who was here a
few days ago, and who has often stopped in
the hotel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir," she answered, "I know him
quite well, and a very pleasant, generous gentleman
he is&#8211;or rather" (and her face changed
at some recollection), "or rather was."</p>

<p>I caught her up eagerly. "<i>Was?</i>" I echoed.
"Wasn't he the same as usual this last time?"</p>

<p>"No, that he wasn't, sir. I thought to myself,
thinks I, 'Mr. Farnham must have been
disappointed in love or something,' he was so
grumpy and dull. Always before when he
came he had a good word for me, 'How do you
do, Ginnie?' or a smile and a nod, but now he
went by me without a sign, for all the world as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
if he'd never seen me before, though I've been
here since I was seventeen; that's six years ago.
When I spoke to him first, why he looked up
and answered in a mumbling way, never even
saying my name. But then, poor gentleman,
I suppose he was too sick to think of anybody
except himself."</p>

<p>"Did he look strangely?" I went on to
question.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about that, sir, except for
the green shade he had to wear over his eyes; I
suppose his face was much the same. Only I
didn't get many chances to see it, and all his
jolly ways and smiles were gone, so that made
a difference. I was so glad when I saw his
baggage coming up, for there's never been a
gentleman so popular with us girls as Mr.
Farnham; but except for his giving me something
when he went away, he might almost as
well not have been in the hotel."</p>

<p>"Would you have recognised his voice," I
asked, "if you had not seen him?"</p>

<p>"I would when he was well and like himself,
sir, in a minute, but not this time, because of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
the bad cold he'd got on the voyage, which he
said was the worst he'd ever had. He did
nothing but cough and wheeze, and could only
speak in a hoarse sort of whisper."</p>

<p>These details were all I could extract from
"Ginnie" the chambermaid; but before I left
the hotel it occurred to me to examine the visitors'
book for Farnham's name, wishing to look
at the handwriting which, if his, I felt sure I
could not fail to recognise. As I searched the
pages vainly I thought with some compunction
of Farnham himself, remembering how I had
hardly known, on the evening of our unexpected
meeting in London, whether or not to
be genuinely pleased to see him. I had feared
to have too much of his society during the few
hours at the St. James's Theatre; yet ever
since, by a strange irony of fate, I had been
doomed to pursue him, to think of little that
was not in some way or other connected with
Harvey Farnham and his affairs.</p>

<p>Evidently he had not considered it worth his
while to write in the visitors' book on this occasion,
though I found that he had scrawled his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
name when staying in the hotel some months
before. This counted for nothing definite, of
course; and as for the taciturnity of which
the chambermaid complained, the ailments
from which my poor friend was reported to
have been suffering were quite enough to account
for that. Still, through her words and
those of the man in the bar, I had gained my
only real evidence&#8211;if evidence it might be
called&#8211;and as such I treasured the scanty
information.</p>

<p>Having by dint of some exertion found the
cabman who had driven Farnham from the
hotel to the railway depot, I made sure that his
luggage had been "checked" to Denver, and
so set forth again with a feeling that I had
something to go upon.</p>

<p>Never had a journey seemed to me so endless.
After Chicago the interminable plains
got upon my nerves, and I looked out eagerly
for the first range of the snow-clad Rockies.</p>

<p>The trip had taken the best part of three
days, and it was early morning when I arrived
in busy Denver, where the dry cold wind and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
the whirring shrieks of electric trams made me
feel that I had left the place but yesterday.
Much was changed, and many more tall, handsome
blocks of pink stone had been erected during
my four years' absence; still I easily found
my way to the building where Harvey Farnham
had offices.</p>

<p>It was just past breakfast time, but the
business world of Denver, Colorado, and the
"great West" is astir at an hour which would
appear unusual in England. I asked for Mr.
Farnham, and was told by a young clerk that
he had returned to Denver three or four days
previously. He had not been at the offices, as
he was somewhat unwell as yet, but if I chose
I could see Mr. Bennett, who would tell me
when he might be expected.</p>

<p>I remembered Bennett, now that I was reminded
of his existence, as an energetic young
fellow high in Farnham's confidence, who
probably knew as much about the mining and
other financial interests as did his employer. I
said therefore that I would see Mr. Bennett
by all means.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>He came in to me briskly in a few moments,
surprised, and, he said, delighted to meet me
again. Yes, it was quite true that Mr. Farnham
had returned, but was as yet unable to be
troubled by business affairs.</p>

<p>This settled the matter, then, I assured myself.
There was nothing left for me to do but
rejoice in Farnham's safety, curse my own
idiocy for harbouring fantastic suspicions,
despite all evidence which should long ago have
overthrown them, and proceed to retrace my
six thousand mile journey across the continent
and the Atlantic.</p>

<p>I should at all events have the satisfaction,
I bitterly reflected, that I had done my best to
serve Karine's interests and my own, and I
should arrive in England in plenty of time to
see her married to the man I had vainly attempted
to prove a murderer.</p>

<p>I became for the first moment conscious that
I was desperately weary, that I had eaten little
during the past few days, and slept less. I
had not troubled myself to breakfast that
morning&#8211;devouring food had seemed so utterly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
irrelevant&#8211;and now for an instant, as
Mr. Bennett's words rang in my ears, a curious
sudden dizziness overpowered me. I felt sick
and faint, and realised that life was a failure,
with nothing worth living for in future, since
Karine Cunningham would soon be Karine
Wildred.</p>

<p>"You look ill, Mr. Stanton," remarked Bennett.
"I guess you've had a tiresome journey.
I know what a bad run that is between Chicago
and Denver."</p>

<p>A nasty run, indeed! But it would be much
worse going back again, leaving the house of
cards, which I had come so far to see, lying in
ruins behind me. Still, I continued to beat
into my brains the fact that I rejoiced in poor
old Farnham's safety.</p>

<p>"I believe I am a bit knocked out," I said,
"though I ought to be able to stand a trifle
like that and think nothing of it. I should
be glad to see Mr. Farnham. I suppose such
an old friend as I might venture to call in on
him, even though he isn't feeling as fit as I
should like to think him. If he's not likely to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
turn up here presently I might drive to the
house, and he'd give me breakfast, I daresay."</p>

<p>I saw before I had finished my second sentence
that Bennett was slightly disturbed. He
flushed to the roots of his flaxen hair, and his
face wore an expression which betrayed a suppressed
desire to whistle.</p>

<p>"You can bet he would give you breakfast,
or anything else he had, Mr. Stanton," the
trusted man of business said heartily, yet with
a certain irresolution. "But the fact is, he
ain't at the house this morning. He's gone
away again."</p>

<p>"I thought he was unwell," I interpolated,
in surprise.</p>

<p>"That's so. He's a sick man, not hardly fit
to be about, but for all that he's off. He ought
to be back again in&#8211;well, in a few days, however."</p>

<p>"A few days!" I echoed.</p>

<p>"More or less. By George! he will be mad
when he knows he's kept you waiting. For, of
course, you <i>will</i> wait, won't you, Mr. Stanton?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>"I should certainly like to see him before
I go back to the East," I said; and I spoke no
more than the truth, for, putting my cordial
feeling for Farnham out of the question, it
might be that valuable information concerning
Wildred's past could be wrested from him with
due diplomacy. "Still, I hardly feel like
hanging about Denver for an indefinite length
of time, doing nothing. I shouldn't mind a
little journey, as I've come so far. If he's at
any of the Colorado mines, perhaps I might
run out and join him; I've been there with him
before, you may remember."</p>

<p>"You might indeed, sir," returned Bennett,
still embarrassed, "if he was in any such
place, which he isn't. To tell you the plain
truth, Mr. Stanton, as I'm sure Mr. Farnham
would wish, if he could dream it was <i>you</i> I was
talking to, why, this little journey of his is
strictly on the 'Q. T.' I guess from what he
said there's a lady mixed up in it."</p>

<p>Exactly what Wildred had said, when explaining
his friend's absence on Christmas Day
from the House by the Lock! I remembered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
the coincidence, though I could hardly see that
it bore with any importance on the present
case. Farnham might hold several feminine
trump cards to play at the end of a trick for
all I knew, or had a right to know.</p>

<p>"I tell you what to do, Mr. Stanton," Bennett
continued, recovering his wonted self-possession.
"You just go up to the house, and
make yourself at home there till Mr. Farnham
gets back. You know what a big place it is,
and how glad the chief is to fill it with his
friends, especially such friends as you. Then,
by the end of next week, anyhow&#8213;"</p>

<p>I interrupted him impatiently. "What,
will he be away till then?"</p>

<p>"I should think it was probable from what
he said before he left, sir."</p>

<p>"I wish," I exclaimed desperately, "that
you could see your way to making things a
little clearer for me. I don't want to pry into
Farnham's affairs, of course&#8211;that goes without
saying. But perhaps, without any betrayal
of confidence, you might let me know exactly
what he did tell you in regard to his return."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>"Well," said Bennett, with a short laugh,
"seeing it's you! The fact is, Mr. Stanton,
it'll be a considerable relief to my mind to talk
over the matter, and ask your opinion as to one
or two points that have been rather troubling
me."</p>

<p>He glanced up into my face, almost for the
first time since we had begun the discussion,
and I saw that I was to hear something which
he considered of importance.</p>

<p>Of how great importance it was to prove for
me, I did not dare to dream.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>A Picture from the Past</span></h2>

<p>"The fact is," said Bennett, "I haven't
quite known what to make of Mr. Farnham
since he's been back on this side the herring-pond.
Of course he hasn't been well, but that
would hardly be enough to account for the
change in him. Did you see him, may I ask,
Mr. Stanton, when he was in England?"</p>

<p>I informed him that I had done so, not
thinking it best to volunteer the statement that
I had only met him once.</p>

<p>"And did he seem like himself?"</p>

<p>This was rather turning the tables upon me.
I was not prepared to answer many questions,
but without hesitation I replied to this one,
saying that, in my opinion, Farnham had
seemed uncommonly jolly and well.</p>

<p>Bennett looked thoughtful. "He got home
here in Denver at night," he said, "after telegraphing
from New York he was coming; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
went to call at his request&#8211;another wire&#8211;not
a letter&#8211;and he saw me in bed. Mr. Farnham
is fond of plenty of light and noise as a rule,
but in his bedroom he had refused to have the
electricity turned on, and there was only a
lamp on the table, as far as possible from the
bed. I called out, 'How do you do?' in my
usual tones, but he answered me almost in a
whisper. There were some important papers
which had been waiting for him to sign, and
I had taken them with me, thinking he'd be
anxious to attend to them&#8211;he was always so
keen and prompt in business&#8211;but he seemed
quite angry when I suggested it, and said he
wasn't to be bothered about anything of the
sort for a week.</p>

<p>"Next evening I saw him again for a few
moments, and there was the same dim light,
the same whispering. He was going away
again immediately, he informed me, and when
I objected that he didn't seem up to travelling,
he answered that when there was a lady in the
case there was no question of a man being 'up
to' things. I might send his letters to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
Santa Anna Hotel, San Francisco, he went on,
until further notice, which I should receive by
telegraph in about ten days if his plans went
well. Just as I was going he said, kind of
laughing and yet partly in earnest too, 'Well,
Bennett, if you don't hear from me at the end
of that time, you'd better begin to look me up.
The game that I mean to try and win is a dangerous
one. There are others who want the
lady beside myself.'</p>

<p>"Now, if there was a town on the face of the
earth that Mr. Farnham used to hate, that
town was San Francisco. It was because he
hated the journey, and never wanted to take it
again, that he sold his mine out in California
to the English gentleman, Mr. Wildred. I
wouldn't have supposed that there was a
woman alive would have got him to go to San
Francisco, and I used to think, too, that Mr.
Farnham didn't care much for women; but no
doubt the longer one lives the more one learns,
and the more surprises one gets in such matters.
I needn't say much about his being away
from Denver for a few days, even at the office,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
he hinted to me; and with that we parted.
Next morning early he left, and not a line have
I had except a wire, merely announcing his
safe arrival at the Santa Anna Hotel."</p>

<p>I listened in silence. Before Bennett had
finished speaking my thoughts were far away&#8211;as
far as San Francisco.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" I exclaimed aloud, with a rushing
of blood to my brain that pulsed to bursting
in the little veins at my temples. "<i>The
Santa Anna Hotel!</i>"</p>

<p>"Do you know it, Mr. Stanton?" enquired
Bennett, evidently surprised at my sudden
vehemence.</p>

<p>"I was there once many years ago," I said.
"The name has brought back an old association
to my mind which I had thought was lost."</p>

<p>I knew now where I had seen those strange
light eyes of Carson Wildred's, and what was
the deed with which they had connected themselves
in my mind. After all, perhaps, I had
not come to America for nothing!</p>

<p>My memory travelled back over a space of
ten years. I had then come back to San Francisco
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
after an expedition into distant wilds
with a party of friends shooting grizzlies in
the Rockies. I had stopped at the Santa Anna
Hotel, a small hostelry lately built, having an
English landlord, and therefore greatly frequented
by Englishmen.</p>

<p>On the night of my arrival there had been a
serious disturbance in the house. Three men
who had been stopping at the place got quarrelling
over a game of cards which they were
playing in a private parlour. Two, who were
the hosts, and were entertaining the third, had
set upon him with intent to kill, being accused
of cheating. I and several of my friends had
run out from the billiard-room, hearing a yell
for help, just in time to see a man in evening
dress stagger, bleeding, from the opposite
door. "I'm killed! That devil has murdered
me!" he exclaimed, and fell forward on
his face.</p>

<p>At Bennett's mention of the Santa Anna
Hotel the whole scene had come up before me
as vividly as though it had been enacted but
yesterday. The open door, showing a brilliantly-lighted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
interior; cards scattered on the
carpet; a young man&#8211;almost a boy&#8211;standing,
as if frozen with horror, by an overset
table; a large bowie knife, common to the
country, apparently fallen from his right hand
to the floor.</p>

<p>At the door itself an older man, who had
followed the victim, no doubt with the intention
of keeping him from making an outcry
or escaping into the hall. But he had been too
late, and the expression of his face as he met
our eyes was hideous. Though the knife had
to all appearance been used by his companion,
it was at <i>him</i> that the murdered man had
pointed before he fell and died. <i>He</i> was the
one apostrophised as "that devil" by the
death-stricken wretch; and though he had had
a high, aquiline nose, red hair, and bristling
auburn brows that met across his forehead, the
eyes had been those of Carson Wildred.</p>

<p>They were eyes not easy to forget, especially
as they blazed defiance into those of the men
who sprang forward to lay hands upon him.
"There stands the murderer, gentlemen, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
you see," he had said, making a gesture towards
his young companion, a boy of eighteen
or nineteen, who seemed too astonished and
horrified to move. Despite the evidence of the
fallen knife, however, not one among the men
who witnessed the end of the scene believed
that the youth was guilty. Murder was in the
eyes of the other, and must have betrayed him,
even if the last words of the dead man had not
accused him.</p>

<p>California was somewhat wilder in those
days than it is at present, and men were more
ready to act upon impulse. So it was that, as
two of us gripped the fierce, red-haired fellow,
another of the party flung some whispered
word to the boy, who had only spoken to
murmur brokenly, "God knows I'm innocent!"</p>

<p>What that whispered word was no one knew
save he who spoke it and he to whom it was addressed.
But whatever it might have been, it
seemed to rouse the young man to life and a
realisation of his position. With a leap he was
at the long window and had sprung out on to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
a verandah, which ran round three sides and
three stories of the house. The room was on
the first floor, and it was easy enough for an
active young fellow to let himself down by one
of the twisted pillars which supported the
verandah of the lower storey.</p>

<p>It could not have been so easy to escape
those who half-heartedly followed; but the boy
must have found some safe sanctuary near by,
for not only did he evade his pursuers, but was
never found or brought to trial.</p>

<p>The other, an Australian, calling himself
Willis Collins, known as a gambler, suspected
as a card "sharper," was less fortunate. But
for the cry of the dying man he might have
cleared himself; but his reputation was against
him to begin with; it was proved that the other
was a young Englishman who had lost his
money through Collins, and been duped by
him, and altogether matters went hardly with
the elder of the two confederates. He was
tried and condemned (not for murder, as it
happened, but manslaughter), and sentenced
to imprisonment for twenty years.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>The incident had passed out my mind until,
on a visit to America six years later (four
years previous to my present one), a man who
had been of our bear-shooting party in the
Rocky Mountains had chanced to mention that
the fellow had very cleverly succeeded in making
his escape from the prison where he had
been confined.</p>

<p>I had had no personal interest in the affair,
and though it had made considerable impression
upon me at that time, through being called
up at the trial as a witness, I do not suppose
I had summoned it to my recollection for many
a long day until now, at the mention of the
Santa Anna Hotel.</p>

<p>It was no wonder, I told myself, that I had
not been able to decide where and how I had
seen Carson Wildred previous to the night
when Farnham had introduced us to each other
at the theatre. Unless I could collect proofs
not at present in my possession, it would even
now be useless to instill my conviction into the
mind of anyone else.</p>

<p>Carson Wildred had a peculiarly flat nose;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
Willis Collins had had a particularly high one.
Carson Wildred's hair was inky black; Willis
Collins's had been a bright auburn. Wildred's
face was smooth; Collins's mouth and chin had
been concealed by a heavy though close-cropped
red beard. So far as I knew there
was but one man living who could have
effected so radical a change, not only in the
appearance, but in the actual conformation of
features, in the countenance of any human being,
and that was an old fellow in Paris, who
had gained a reputation and a fortune among
men who had reason to cut loose from the
moorings of their past. I had met this famous
(or infamous) person in a curious way, and
had heard some strange stories from his lips.
If I had made his acquaintance, why should
not Collins or Wildred have done so and
profited by the friendship, as fortunately I had
neither the desire nor need to do? I determined
that, unless my present researches were more
successful than I now dared expect them to be,
I would, on my return to the other side, run
across to France, and endeavour to piece together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
the bits of this old but newly-discovered
puzzle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, I had other work, and
work closer at hand.</p>

<p>"While you've been talking, Mr. Bennett,"
said I, "I have been coming to a conclusion."</p>

<p>He smiled. "I'm glad of that, sir," he returned.
"I have risked betraying Mr. Farnham's confidence
that I may ask you what you
think of that last hint of his, which, to tell the
truth, has troubled me very much, coming, as
it did, on top of so many queer actions. Although
he was, or pretended to be, half in joke,
ought I to let him stay away without taking
any measures to find out whether his life really
was threatened in California, and trying to
help him out of a scrape if necessary? Of
course, if it was all straight he'd be furious to
have a watch set on his actions, and would
never forgive me the indiscretion. Still, I
haven't heard from him, as I said, since the
day of his arrival, and neither my mind nor my
conscience is very easy, Mr. Stanton. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
question is, What would you do if you were in
my place?"</p>

<p>I was delighted at this, and turned half
away, that he might not see my change of
countenance.</p>

<p>"It's rather a difficult position," I said,
slowly, "for <i>you</i>. But there's a simple way
out of it, without the necessity for you to run
any risk of losing Mr. Farnham's favour. I've
been to the Santa Anna Hotel before. There's
no reason why I shouldn't go again if I choose,
and no reason why I should mention having
spoken with you at all if I meet my old friend.
I'm something of a nomad, you know, and if
I'm in England one month, and turn up in
Kamtchatka the next, nobody is ever in the
least surprised."</p>

<p>"But have you been thinking of going to
California?" asked Bennett, half relieved and
half dubious as to the course proposed.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've been thinking of it," I
promptly answered. But I neglected to add
that it had only been during the past five
minutes.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>Face to Face</span></h2>

<p>It was very nearly dinner time, two days
later, when I drove up to the Santa Anna
Hotel in San Francisco. Far away the bay
could be seen and the Seal Rock, with the light
of a great yellow moon touching its dark outlines
and mingling with the blue, wintry twilight.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood was greatly changed
since my last visit, but the hotel remained much
the same. My first thought, after greeting
the bluff old compatriot who kept the house,
was to look at the visitors' book.</p>

<p>My heart gave a quick thump as I came on
the name of Harvey Farnham. It was not in
his handwriting, which, though I had not seen
it for some time, I remembered quite distinctly.</p>

<p>"Ah, gentleman's ill," said the proprietor,
when I cautiously questioned him. "Had his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
arm in a sling&#8211;got my clerk to put his name
down for him, I recollect, as I was standing
by. Mr. Farnham has been out a good deal,
however, since he arrived, and, indeed, is out at
present. He usually comes in about dinner
time though."</p>

<p>This was an incentive to me not to miss that
meal. I got into my evening togs in a hurry
and was in the dining-room before anyone else,
save a hungry-looking old man.</p>

<p>It was not a good season for the "Santa
Anna," so the proprietor had confidentially
informed me, but two or three dozen people
strolled into the room before I had been there
for half an hour. Still, I saw no familiar face,
and was beginning to think in angry desperation
that I had been eluded again, when the
door opened to admit a tall and slender figure.</p>

<p>I looked up, my pulses quickening, my
breath coming fast.</p>

<p>The man had a green shade over his eyes,
was limping slightly, had his right arm in a
sling, and altogether presented a somewhat
battered appearance. But, I said to myself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
if it was not Harvey Farnham it was his twin
brother.</p>

<p>With all my eyes I stared at him. Almost
as though there had been some magnetic influence
in them to draw him he came towards
me, and finally approaching my table, motioned
to the attentive waiter to draw out a
certain chair.</p>

<p>He sat down, leaned back with an audible
sigh, shook out his serviette with his left hand,
slightly pushed up the green shade that shadowed
his eyes, and began looking carelessly
about the room.</p>

<p>As he did so his glance passed over my face.
There was not the slightest hint of recognition
in it. "Hullo, Farnham!" I said, carefully
controlling the agitation in my voice.</p>

<p>He started violently and nearly dropped the
soup spoon, which he had picked up with his
left hand. Then, pulling himself together by
a violent effort, he smiled, without any of the
old cordiality. Almost mechanically he had
reached up for the green shade, and given it
a hasty pull downward.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>"Hullo!" he responded in a hoarse voice,
following the word with a cough. "This is a
surprise, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied slowly. "People do run
against each other in unexpected places, don't
they? Now I will wager something that
you've forgotten my name?"</p>

<p>He smiled again, with a relieved expression.
"Well"&#8211;still hoarsely&#8211;"I'm afraid I have,
for a moment. It'll come back, no doubt, but
would you mind enlightening me, meanwhile?"</p>

<p>"My name is Noel Stanton," I very quietly
said. But I could have shouted aloud. Notwithstanding
the extraordinary resemblance,
this man was no more Harvey Farnham than
I was!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A Counterfeit Presentment</span></h2>

<p>We had not much talk together. The few
questions which I cautiously put evidently
rendered him uncomfortable, and I on my part,
having made sure of one all-potent fact, was
anxious to get away and think the puzzle over.</p>

<p>I was at the last course of my dinner when
the man entered, and having finished I rose.</p>

<p>"Are you stopping long in San Francisco?"
I asked, with my best air of carelessness.</p>

<p>"A couple of days or so," he said. "See
you again to-morrow, I daresay." It was
plain that he was glad to get rid of me. Naturally
he was afraid of all men, strangers to
him, who claimed knowledge of him as Harvey
Farnham. He was playing a bold and
dangerous game, and no doubt he was aware
that, unless he kept himself in hand, and never
for an instant lost his presence of mind, any
moment might find him beaten.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>So dizzy was I with the fumes of my discovery
that my brain would not answer to my
command. I could not think. I could only
say over and over again&#8211;"Not Harvey Farnham!
The fellow is a mere decoy!"</p>

<p>Out in the open I knew that I should have
a better chance of mastering myself. On the
way to the door I stepped into the "office"
again and glanced at the visitors' book. Harvey
Farnham's name was written down opposite
the number 249, and I knew, therefore,
that his room must be near, and in the same
wing in the back as mine.</p>

<p>The glorious salt wind soon restored me to
myself, and I wandered through some of the
streets I had known and forgotten, thinking
busily. I could understand much now that
had been dark to me, though even yet far
too much for my peace of mind remained
hidden.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that this counterfeit presentment
of a dead man (for I was certain
enough now that poor Farnham was dead)
had cumbered himself with bandages, and simulated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
sprains, and thickened his voice with an
alleged bronchitis. There was a wonderful
family likeness between voices, when they only
spoke in a rough whisper, and the green shade
over the eyes had doubtless proved very advantageous
in keeping up the optical illusion
on which the man had courageously dared to
count, even among Farnham's Denver friends.
To be sure he had hurried away as soon as possible
from every place where he had stayed
since arriving at New York on the <i>St. Paul</i>.
In each one he had accomplished an object
vital to the interest of the plot. He had been
able to refute the story of Harvey Farnham's
murder, in person, and having evidently been
well grounded in all prominent facts connected
with Farnham's life, habits, and trip
to England, had made a <i>coup</i> in his interview
with the New York police.</p>

<p>Having done all that was necessary in the
east, he had then taken the final and most
hazardous step of going to Farnham's home.
It was hardly remarkable, therefore, that he
had seized the opportunity of escaping so trying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
an ordeal at once. It seemed to me impossible
that he should intend returning to
Denver, where, in the light of day, and among
old business and domestic associates, he could
not long hope to escape detection, perfect as
the likeness seemed to be. What, then, would
he do, I eagerly asked myself? He had so far
been successful in establishing the fact all along
his route that Harvey Farnham had not only
returned in safety to America, but had shown
himself at home. So much having been gained,
Wildred must perforce be relieved of all suspicion
of the crime which I had tried to fasten
upon him, and this being the case, I assured
myself that it was Wildred's hand only which
had contrived this intricate and ingenious plot.
This man, disguised as Farnham, was in Wildred's
pay, there could be no doubt of that,
and had in all probability been engaged for the
purpose he was now carrying out before the
murder had taken place.</p>

<p>I tried as I walked to put myself in the
place of the schemers, and thus hew out,
through an intimate mental process, some idea
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
as to how the loose ends of the mystery were
to be disposed of.</p>

<p>"If I were that fellow," I said to myself
at last, "I should think it was about time to
disappear. I should feel sure I'd come to the
end of my tether, and that somehow or other
Harvey Farnham, as represented by me, had
got to be unostentatiously wiped out."</p>

<p>Farnham, however, was too rich and important
a man in the western states of his own
country to disappear conveniently and with impunity.
There would be a hue and cry, and
suspicious facts might somehow be brought to
light. The only safe way, I decided, would be
for the alleged Harvey Farnham to kill himself;
but this it did not appear very likely that
the most dazzling bribe could induce him to do.
He meant to find some more comfortable way
out of the hole into which he had so deliberately
crept than the way of suicide, and it began to
seem that the only method by which I could
prove my case would be by finding out what
that way was to be.</p>

<p>At present, unless I could have the fellow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
arrested, and such disguise as he might wear
dragged off, I should have great difficulty in
obtaining credence of my story. The incidents
were all so remarkable that they must be certified
with the best of evidence, and such evidence
as I wanted could only be forthcoming from
Bennett, or someone else in Denver who knew
Farnham equally well.</p>

<p>What I must do, I thought, would be to
keep on the man's track, and never for an hour
lose sight of him. I must do this without
arousing any suspicion on his part as to my
motives until the last moment, when I should
be prepared to accuse him.</p>

<p>This conclusion naturally reminded me that
at the very moment it was reached I had virtually
lost sight of my quarry, and that already
I might have missed my chance. Accordingly,
I hurried back to the Santa Anna Hotel, and
though it was then too late to wire Bennett, I
determined to do so early the next morning.
I would request him to come on to San Francisco
at once on a matter of extreme importance,
and&#8211;his mind being already disturbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
concerning his employer&#8211;he would lose no
time in obeying. In Bennett, if I could fairly
corner the bogus Farnham, I should have the
most valuable witness in the world.</p>

<p>My first question was as to whether Mr.
Farnham were in the hotel. He had not yet
returned from a call which he had gone to make
after dinner, and I sat down, therefore, in the
corridor inside the front doors, through which
he would have to pass on entering.</p>

<p>I pretended to be absorbed in a local paper,
but in reality my thoughts were a maelstrom.
Suppose he had already escaped me!</p>

<p>At half-past eleven, however, he came in. I
did not seem to lift my eyes from the pages
before them. He would have to go directly
by me on his way upstairs; time enough to appear
to observe him then.</p>

<p>"Cablegram for you, Mr. Farnham," said
the clerk of the hotel.</p>

<p>"Ah!" The exclamation was one of surprise.
He had not, then, been expecting the
message.</p>

<p>I could not resist looking up after all to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
watch him in the act of reading it, and as I
did so my eyes caught a gleam from his, under
the green shade, as they turned to my face
with an expression that was like a hunted animal's.
In the instant I was as positive as
though he had told me in so many words that
the cablegram he had received was from Carson
Wildred, and intimately concerned me.
Probably it said, "If a man named Noel Stanton
turns up, he is an enemy&#8211;beware of him."</p>

<p>I regretted immediately that I had given
him my real name when we met at dinner, for,
warned now by Wildred, he would be ever on
his guard. He was seized with a creditable fit
of coughing as he passed me, and having
growled out something about being "deuced
tired, and sleeping like a log," he went upstairs.</p>

<p>I followed him in time to see him enter his
own room, which was only half a dozen doors
from mine, and to hear him noisily lock the
door. It occurred to me that he was desirous
to have me know that he <i>had</i> locked it, and I
wondered if already he had begun to suspect
my motive.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>Fire!</span></h2>

<p>I went to bed determined not to sleep, but
to keep my ears open for any sound in the passage
outside. Luckily there was a creaky board
on which he had stepped a few minutes ago.
If he attempted to go away during the night
he would very possibly step on it again. But
I was exceedingly tired after my long journey.
Before I had been in bed an hour I was dreaming
so vividly a pursuit of my quarry through
the streets of San Francisco, that I fully believed
I had waked, got up, and gone out after
him.</p>

<p>In the end the dream seemed to change.
The pretender had boarded a railway train,
and I was with the engine-driver of another,
following at a dare-devil speed. The place was
reeking hot. In my dream I choked in the
smoke which flew into my face, and was dazzled
with the red glare of the fire, on which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
engine-driver was piling great pieces of fat
bacon. As we flew along the rails the locomotive
swayed from side to side, and I could hear
a loud rattling of wheels and of window glass.</p>

<p>Suddenly a puff of smoke seemed on the
very point of stifling me, and I awoke to find
myself sitting up in bed and gasping for
breath.</p>

<p>I had not dreamed the rattling of glass, nor
the jarring sensation, nor yet the smoke and
heat and lurid light. The walls shook with a
dull vibration, and the window-panes were like
castanets. Through the glass transom over the
door I could see a shimmering, ruddy glow that
rose and fell, and was brightened by bursting
sparks and little darting tongues of yellow
flame. Apart from this one lurid spot all was
thickly curtained into darkness by a heavy pall
of smoke.</p>

<p>Had I lain for a few moments longer I must
have suffocated in my sleep. Even as it was,
my brain felt dull and stupid, and I could
scarcely collect my senses.</p>

<p>Choking and coughing, tears running from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
my eyes that smarted with the pungent wood
smoke, I sprang out of bed, and then sat down
again with a slight exclamation, drawing up
my feet. The floor was so hot that the touch
of it, even for an instant, had almost scorched
my skin.</p>

<p>Close at hand were my boots. I drew them
on and then fumbled about for one or two
articles of clothing. The wild light that rushed
past the transom told me that escape by way
of the passage was already cut off, and even
as I looked a small, curling tress of flame blew
in through the crack between the door and the
worn sill.</p>

<p>The window was less easy to find. As I
felt for it through the veil of smoke strange
conjectures stole into my brain. What if this
were the plan of Carson Wildred's wily accomplice
for getting safely rid of me?</p>

<p>I had no intention of being got rid of thus
easily, however. I found the window and
opened the lower sash. With the rush of air
from outside my oppressed lungs got relief for
a second or two, but the draught drew in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
flames that rioted through the hall; the glass
in the transom, already cracked, burst with a
loud explosive sound, and a torrent of fire and
smoke poured in through the aperture.</p>

<p>Had I not leaped on to the window-sill, and
without an instant's hesitation let myself swing
over, I could not have kept my senses in that
raging furnace.</p>

<p>If I had had a room in the main building of
the hotel, I should only have had to step on to
a verandah outside my window, but in this
wing (which I had chosen as my place of residence
because I had inhabited it before) there
was nothing of the sort, and I had now the
space of about ten seconds to decide whether
to jump or have my hands burnt off my wrists.</p>

<p>In any case the decision could not have been
a difficult one, but, as it happened, the need
was rendered the more imperative by the fact
that smoke had already begun to pour from
the window below. Very shortly escape would
be cut off in all directions.</p>

<p>My room was on the second floor, high
enough to give me a severe fall, perhaps a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
fatal one, and I felt that my life was of value
now. Cautiously but hurriedly I reached out
with one hand to the side of the window, hanging
with all my weight from the other, which
clutched the sill. My groping fingers came in
contact with a twisted rope of creepers; bare
of leaves for winter, and serviceable for the use
I wished to put it to. I grasped the thick stems
for dear life, and went down hand over hand,
dimly hearing voices from below cheering me
in my descent.</p>

<p>I had been unconscious of the noise until
that moment, but as my feet touched the
ground I was received with acclamations, and
saw that a crowd was rapidly collecting on the
spot. The firemen were arriving, and as I
reached <i>terra firma</i> a great spout of water went
up over the burning wing.</p>

<p>The main portion of the house, which was
built of stone, save for the surrounding verandahs
was still uninjured, but the wing at the
back, which had been a later addition, run
hastily up to meet the needs of business, was of
frame, and it was burning like tinder. Though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
it seemed that the alarm had only been given
five minutes before my appearance on the
scene, already it was beyond saving. My reason
for preferring the wing I have already
stated, but what the pretended Harvey Farnham's
had been I had yet to learn, for so far
was the main portion of the hotel from being
crowded on this occasion, that we two had been
the only ones who slept in the annex. Otherwise
the alarm must have been given from inside,
instead of by a policeman, who had seen
a sudden light leap up while passing on his
beat.</p>

<p>Where was Mr. Farnham? That was the
question asked by the excited landlord, who,
half-dressed, had come out to give what help
he could. By this time a sheet of flame was
pouring from his windows, so much more violent
than in any other portion of the fated
wing, that I could but fancy, as I looked up,
that the fire must have started thereabouts.</p>

<p>The only hope was to save the main building&#8211;the
frame addition had been doomed from
the first. Everyone had come out, guests and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
servants alike, in varying stages of deshabille,
which might under ordinary circumstances have
struck one as comic enough, but the supposed
Farnham was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>When it became known that there was another
occupant of the burning annex, the firemen
made heroic efforts to reach the windows
on their ladders, but each time they were
beaten back by the blinding flame and smoke&#8211;a
salamander could not have existed there
for an instant.</p>

<p>Murmurs of horror and dismay came from
the lips of the crowd as they stared with a
species of fearful fascination at the flames,
which must long ago have destroyed, not only
life, but all vestiges of humanity, if indeed a
human being had been there when they began
their revel. But I said nothing. I thought
now that I understood the reason why my
friend had taken the room in the frame addition
to the Santa Anna Hotel. The plan commenced
to take form in my mind, and I believed
that the cablegram had only precipitated
its execution.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>"It's Dogged as Does It"</span></h2>

<p>Fortunately, to prevent delay and temporary
embarrassment, there was plenty of gold
for present needs in the pockets of the one
garment which I had put on before escaping.
Everything else which I had brought to the
Santa Anna Hotel was lost; but never, perhaps,
was a man more completely indifferent
to such loss than I. The only thing on the
American side of the Atlantic which now interested
me was to find out whether the false
Harvey Farnham had actually (by an irony
of fate) perished in the flames, or whether&#8211;as
I more than suspected&#8211;he himself was responsible
for the fire.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to ascertain the truth
until such time as the ruins of the burnt wing
of the hotel should have sufficiently cooled to
render a search practicable. Even then, if no
other measures were taken, the fact might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
never be absolutely substantiated. If nothing
more was ever heard of Harvey Farnham, it
would probably be taken for granted that he
had met his death in the fire at the Santa Anna
Hotel, even though no actual traces of his
body were forthcoming. His heirs, whoever
they might be, would doubtless claim their
inheritance, and even assurance money, if such
there were to be had, before many months had
passed. Carson Wildred would be for ever
safe, and my quest would have ended in nothing
but bitterness and disappointment.</p>

<p>This being the case, I could not afford to
wait until the burnt building should be ransacked
for Harvey Farnham's remains, I must
take it for granted that no such remains were
there, and go in search of the living, breathing
body. I tried to put myself mentally in place
of the man who had stolen his identity from the
dead. Were I he, I thought, and had I done
that of which I believed he had been guilty,
I would lose no time in putting myself beyond
the reach of possible pursuit. I would have
laid my plans with some exactitude, and would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
have been prepared for the necessity of flight.
I would have thrown aside as many details of
my likeness to Harvey Farnham as nature had
not provided me with, and having set fire to
the room I had occupied, I would have got out
of the hotel as quietly and quickly as practicable.
If it had been comparatively easy for
me to escape by means of the creepers down
the side of the house, the same means might
well have been employed by the man whose
movements I was mentally trying to follow.</p>

<p>Success having attended my movements so
far, I should have gone straight to a railway
station, and would never have breathed freely
until I had left San Francisco well behind me.</p>

<p>So wise, under the given circumstances, did
this course of action seem to me, that I
promptly decided no other would have been
feasible. The thing for me to do, therefore,
was to find out what trains left San Francisco
during the night time. I thought I might
calculate upon the fellow's having boarded a
passenger train in an open and ordinary manner
as, if his plans had been properly laid, no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
suspicion could attach to him, and there would
be no necessity for more desperate precautions.</p>

<p>He could have had a good start before the
fire spread and was discovered, and&#8211;still taking
it for granted that I was correct in my deductions&#8211;the
sooner I was on his track the
better. My hands were burned, I was practically
without clothes, and had suffered a considerable
nervous shock, which at another time
I might have had leisure to feel and analyse.</p>

<p>But I did neither at the present juncture.
I simply procured a stiff portion of brandy
neat, drank it at a gulp, purchased a few
articles of clothing from an accommodating
waiter, dressed myself with all speed, and set
off to the principal railway station, or "depot,"
of San Francisco.</p>

<p>"It's dogged as does it," I quoted to myself,
with a certain grimness of resolution, when my
spirits began to flag.</p>

<p>As I got inside the station there was a
certain bustle and stir of departure or arrival
in the air. "Train going out or coming in?"
I asked shortly of a sleepy porter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>"Going out&#8211;Salt Lake City," grumbled
the man in reply.</p>

<p>I don't know why I instantly felt the conviction
that the bogus Farnham was in that
train, but I did feel it, and so intensely that
when I saw the long line of cars beginning to
move it seemed to me that not to reach it and
jump on board would mean the ruin of my
life.</p>

<p>I have a dim recollection of persons shouting
at me, of feeling a detaining hand trying to
drag me back. I remember, too, thrashing out
with considerable force, ridding myself of my
would-be preserver. I caught on by the rear
platform, and after flying helplessly for an
instant like a ribbon in the wind as the train
increased its speed, I got a foothold and
climbed up the steps.</p>

<p>At the top was a negro night porter, ash-coloured
with fright. He helped to pull me
on board, and I tipped him generously (when
I began to regain my breath and scattered
wits) for agreeing not to make an excitement
by reporting the affair to the conductor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>I panted out that I wanted a berth, found
that there would be a vacant one on board the
"sleeper" at my disposal, and sat down in the
smoking-room, ostensibly to wait while the bed
was made up for me.</p>

<p>I must have been a curious object to look
upon in my dishevelled and hybrid costume,
not an article of which, save the boots and
trousers, had been made for me. But I had no
thoughts to waste upon my own appearance.
I sat wondering at the unhesitating way in
which I had rushed ahead, and staked my all
on this one throw of the dice, so to say. If my
man had not left San Francisco, or if he <i>had</i>
left, and in another direction, in great probability
I had lost all trace of him for ever.
Yet I had flung myself on board this train as
though I had had my quarry in my eye, and
had but to put out my hand to lay hold upon
him. I was now beginning to be very much
astonished at myself.</p>

<p>Having come on board, however, I would
at once begin a tour of exploration, I resolved,
going from one end of the train to the other,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
and not forgetting a visit (with or without
leave) to the "cab" of the engine.</p>

<p>I rose, pulling myself together, and saying
again between my teeth, "Yes, it's dogged as
does it," when a man came into the smoking-room.
I had been alone before.</p>

<p>We looked at each other. He was a tall,
slim, young fellow, with a smooth face. At
sight of me he stopped short, flushed to the
roots of his close-cropped hair, and would
precipitately have retired had I not taken one
quick step forward and grasped him by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>Gone was the curly wig, the beard, and the
lump on the nose, which had been modelled
after Farnham's; gone was the green shade,
the sling, and the limp, but much of the odd
resemblance, which had been heightened in so
artistic a manner, still remained. At last, after
crossing an ocean and a continent to do it, I
had got my hands on the man I had come to
find, and I didn't mean to let him go.</p>

<p>Yes, it certainly had been "dogged" that
had done it.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>A Tell-tale Ornament</span></h2>

<p>"No, you don't!" I remarked, cheerfully,
and with the force of superior muscles I pulled
him towards me. "Come, sit down here by
me," I said. "I want to talk to you." And
somehow it came about that we subsided on
the cushioned seat together.</p>

<p>He had recognised me, of course, as the man
he had seen in the hotel&#8211;the man, Noel Stanton,
against whom I did not doubt his cablegram
had warned him. He was pale as death,
and I could see that this meeting, added, like
the piling of Ossa upon Pelion, on top of
all that he had already gone through, had
robbed him of the shattered remnant of his
nerve.</p>

<p>Still, he was ready to "bluff" and brave if
out while he could. "Confound you!" he exclaimed.
"What are you about? You must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
be mad to attack a stranger without the slightest
provocation. Let me alone, sir, or I'll rouse
the car."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't, you know, if I were you," I
said coolly, for the more excited he grew the
more did my own calmness come back to me.
"You've been playing a dangerous game ever
since you took your passage in the American
liner <i>St. Paul</i> (or, rather, since Carson Wildred
took it for you), but you've never, perhaps,
steered so close to the wind as to-night,
when you resorted to incendiarism as a finishing
stroke."</p>

<p>The fellow stared at me in simulated nonchalance
and defiance, but my hand was on
his shoulder still, and I could feel the shudder
that ran through his body.</p>

<p>"I say you must be mad," he reiterated.</p>

<p>"So you observed before; but I could very
easily prove to you that I'm not, if you were
not already sure of it. You can call for assistance
if you like, but if you do the story I've
got to tell will go flashing over the wires back
to 'Frisco, and on to Denver, and you will find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
yourself in almost as hot a place as if you had
stayed at the Santa Anna Hotel, where you
wanted the world to think that poor Harvey
Farnham had been roasted."</p>

<p>Once more the fit of shivering seized him.
He glanced wildly about, as though to find
some means of escape, but there was none.</p>

<p>"I am a bigger man and a stronger man
than you," I remarked, in a significant and reflective
manner. "Better hear the alternative
I've got to offer. I know everything, you see&#8211;that
is, everything that concerns <i>you</i>, and
the curious game you've been playing.</p>

<p>"I've been just three days behind you everywhere
since you left New York. I've got
every link in the evidence now, and what with
Bennett, of Denver, and the proprietor of the
Santa Anna Hotel, and a few others, I can
burst your wretched little soap bubble plot in
four-and-twenty hours. There's just one way
in which you can stay my hand."</p>

<p>"What's that?" He had spoken out impulsively,
before he had stopped to think. The
instant the words were uttered he saw all that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
they admitted, and bit his lip. But it was too
late; he was completely trapped.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," I said, keeping my hand on
his shoulder, almost caressingly. "I'd listen
attentively, if I were in your place. What you
can do is to make a clean breast of your story
from beginning to end. I'm willing to pay
you more for confessing than Wildred did for
plotting. Then you must go back to England
with me, and stand by while the thing is made
public."</p>

<p>As I spoke he did not once take his eyes
from me. It was remarkable even yet, now
that he was out of his disguise, how strong his
likeness was to Farnham. He might have been
a younger brother.</p>

<p>When I had finished he sighed and drooped
his head. His own hair, which was very closely
cut, was of a beautiful reddish golden colour,
much the shade of Karine Cunningham's, as
the light fell on it from above. I thought of
her with a great wave of passionate love, and
more of hope than I had dared to feel for
many a long day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>Perhaps it was the recollection of her lovely
face and the wonderful halo of her hair which
caused me for an instant to relax my grasp.
I only became conscious of having done so
when the fellow twisted himself from under
my hand, and springing lithely to his feet
would have darted through the swing door had
I not leaped after him like a tiger.</p>

<p>We fought together as the car swayed and
bounded along its tracks. Once he dived under
my arm and was almost out of my clutches,
but I caught him by the collar with so fierce
a grip that the linen of his shirt tore, and the
garment ripped open to the waistcoat.</p>

<p>Something which he wore beneath snapped,
as he still struggled to escape me, and a bright
object flashed under my eyes as it fell, and
dropped with a slight metallic noise to the
floor.</p>

<p>Evidently it was to him an article of value.
Impulsively he stooped, forgetful for a second
of the object which had animated him, and thus
the advantage became all mine again. I had
him pinioned fast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>At our feet, I now had time to observe, lay
a broken gold chain and a locket.</p>

<p>Twisting my hand firmly in his collar I bent
over and picked up the ornaments. "Allow
me," I said, smiling. And as I was about to
put the locket in his hand I could not avoid
seeing the portrait that it framed. It was an
open-faced, old-fashioned thing, set round
with a rim of pearls. The crystal had been
cracked across in the fall, but the delicately
painted ivory miniature within was intact, and
I gave a slight exclamation as I saw that it
represented Karine Cunningham.</p>

<p>If I had been surprised to see her picture in
the "studio" at the House by the Lock, I was
doubly surprised to see it in a locket worn by
a young desperado on the other side of the
world. Impulsively I withdrew my hand
which held the ornament, with the feeling that
the man had no right to it&#8211;that I could not
return it to him again.</p>

<p>"Give it back to me!" he ejaculated, forgetting
his evident fear of me for the first time,
and speaking with a certain manly fierceness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
that thawed the chill of my contempt for him.
"If I've got a right to nothing else on earth,
I've got a right to that. It's a portrait of my
sister."</p>

<p>"<i>Your sister!</i> You swear that?"</p>

<p>"Of course I swear it. I don't see why
you shouldn't know it&#8211;though I haven't done
much credit to the name of Cunningham."</p>

<p>I could not doubt him. Not that I had not
every reason to believe that he would be willing
to lie as fast as he could speak if it happened
to suit his purpose, but the ring of sincerity in
his voice was unmistakable.</p>

<p>I let go my hold upon him. Such was his
astonishment at the man&oelig;uvre that he made
no attempt to take advantage of his freedom,
but simply stood still and stared at me.</p>

<p>"Here is the locket," I said. "I came from
England to California to serve Miss Cunningham's
interests, and I will not lay my hand
upon her brother."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," he said,
sullenly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," I returned, "if you'll sit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
down here and listen to me for a few minutes
longer. After that, as far as I am concerned,
you are free to do as you choose. You look
surprised&#8211;but whatever may have been your
faults and your offences, I would stake my life
you love your sister."</p>

<p>"She is the only being on earth I do love,"
he replied, still half dazedly.</p>

<p>Then he sat down, his eyes furtively on me,
and I seated myself beside him.</p>

<p>"She is sacrificing herself for someone," I
remarked. "I think I begin dimly to understand
now who that someone may be. I think,
too, that circumstances have given me the right
to be inquisitive, as I can still further explain
to you later on. Is Miss Cunningham going
to marry Carson Wildred to save you from
any unpleasant consequences of the past, for
instance?"</p>

<p>He started as though he had been struck.</p>

<p>"She is <i>not</i> going to marry Carson Wildred!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she is, unless it can be prevented.
I see I have even more to tell you than I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
thought. Is it long, may I ask, since you have
seen your sister?"</p>

<p>"Last November," he said drooping his
head, and bringing under my eyes again the
hair that was like hers.</p>

<p>"Ah, that explains your ignorance. The
man had not shown his hand at that time.
Now I am going to trust to your affection for
Miss Cunningham, to your presumable wish to
save her from unhappiness, and talk to you
as though we had been allies instead of enemies.
Perhaps I may be a fool for my pains; but
something seems to say to me&#8213;"</p>

<p>"Something says right. Go on!" he ejaculated,
gruffly.</p>

<p>No doubt the very most dunder-headed of
lawyers or detectives would have told me that
I was mad, thus deliberately to give all my
good trumps away to the treacherous, hired
scoundrel whom I had been hunting down with
the dogged ferocity of a bloodhound. On
principle, of course, I <i>was</i> all wrong, and I
knew it; but still I went on.</p>

<p>I told him the strange story of the past few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
weeks from beginning to end. I commenced
with the part which concerned Farnham and
Carson Wildred alone. I did not pass over
that which had to do with Karine, my hopeless
and unrequited love for her, my passionate
anxiety to serve her at all costs; and I ended
by declaring my certainty that Carson Wildred
and Willis Collins were one and the same man.</p>

<p>"He is doubly a murderer," I said. "And
yet, unless you and I together can keep him
from it, he will be your sister's husband."</p>

<p>"I'll kill him first!" exclaimed my companion.</p>

<p>"I think the trick can be done without resorting
to such extreme measures as that," I returned,
"especially if you are willing to come
over from his camp to mine."</p>

<p>He looked at me sharply for a moment without
answering, then he said:</p>

<p>"You seem pretty quick, I've noticed, in
what you've just been telling me at putting
two and two together. Well, you say you were
at the Santa Anna Hotel the night the murder
was committed ten years ago. You knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
there were two men mixed up in it. You remembered
one of them; would you remember
the other?"</p>

<p>"He was a mere boy," I said, "and it's a
long time ago. He must have changed almost
beyond recognition."</p>

<p>"He's just twenty-nine at present; I've
good reason to know, as I'm he."</p>

<p>It was my turn to be astonished, but it was
not policy to show it. Therefore I merely said,
"Oh, indeed!"</p>

<p>"You see," he went on dully, "that's where
Wildred has had his pull over me since he ran
across me, by a piece of devil's own luck, in
Canada five years ago. As you say, I have
changed; but his eyes are like gimlets, they'd
pierce a stone wall. It's quite true, as you suspected,
that he and Collins are one. I knew
him by a queer scar on his hand, shaped like a
star&#8211;perhaps you've observed it? But he
didn't mind. He seemed even to find a sort
of pleasure in telling me how he had been to a
clever fellow in Paris, and got himself made
over into another man, so that he might the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
more easily turn his back upon various little
episodes of the past. I couldn't have proved
it if I'd wanted to, he was so different, and had
worked up such a new record for himself to
travel on. He knew that, and he knew, too,
that I was in his power."</p>

<p>"I don't exactly see how <i>that</i> came about,"
I objected.</p>

<p>"Don't you? You're not so quick as usual,
then. I'd been accused of the murder at the
Santa Anna Hotel. I hooked it, and got over
to Mexico, so to Spain and France. I'd always
been a black sheep, you know, but that was
the first really serious trouble I'd got into.
However, as I said, five years later, when Wildred
and I met, I was in Canada; I'd turned
actor (I'd always a little talent that way), and
was doing pretty well. He pointed out to me&#8211;and
I wasn't very long in seeing his point&#8211;that
I was not so much changed but what I
should easily be recognised by those who had
known me during those wild days when I'd
been under his thumb in San Francisco, and
the authorities there would still be very glad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
to hear of me. He didn't happen to want anything
of me just then, but he allowed me to
understand that it was to my interest to keep
sweet with him. And from that day to this
he's had his eye on me."</p>

<p>"But it was <i>he</i> who was accused of that
murder, not you," I said.</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>"</p>

<p>The man seemed either not to believe or
understand me.</p>

<p>I repeated the statement, and then, when
he stammered his astonishment, his ignorance
of all that had taken place in San Francisco
after his escape (at which we had all tacitly
connived at the time), I went on to explain
the true circumstances of the case. Carson
Wildred had deceived him into the belief that
he alone had been suspected&#8211;that if he were
caught he would be promptly hanged.</p>

<p>"He has told the same story to your sister,
I would swear!" I exclaimed, hotly. "It is
for this reason that she has been persuaded into
promising to marry him. Believing that he
knows your whereabouts, and holds it in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
power at any moment to have you punished as
a murderer&#8211;believing, too, no doubt, that you
did commit the murder, she has been ready to
save your life by the sacrifice of all that has
made hers dear."</p>

<p>"Curse him! I'd take my oath you're
right!" he asseverated. "He's sly enough and
vile enough for anything."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see Harvey Farnham?" I
questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes, years ago I knew him well, and liked
him immensely&#8211;as he did me, I think. It was
in Tuolumne County, California, where he had
a gold mine&#8211;the Miss Cunningham. It was
I who named that, oddly enough it may seem
to you, after my sister, of course. He wasn't
aware of that, but thought it was just a whim
of mine, that probably I'd admired some girl
called 'Miss Cunningham,' and wanted to pay
her a compliment. You see, no one knew me
by my right name even then.</p>

<p>"It was before that hateful time when I got
in with Collins, or Wildred, whichever you like
to call him, and not long after I'd run away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
from home and England under the assumed
name of Hartley&#8211;it was my mother's maiden
name. I was only seventeen or eighteen, but
I was pretty sharp for my years, I'm afraid,
for I'd been among a queer lot already, and
one night I would have got into a row with
some older man over cards, a row that might
have ended badly if it hadn't been for Mr.
Farnham, who had dropped into the place to
look on, and who stood by me for all he was
worth.</p>

<p>"It seemed he noticed me the moment he
entered the room, thinking that I looked
enough like him to be his own son. Afterward
he took me up, making a lot of me, wanting
to find out where I'd come from, and all
that. He thought my resemblance to him
(which everyone who saw us together invariably
remarked) a wonderful joke, and used
to call me his 'boy,' and 'sonny,' getting it into
his head that I was a sort of 'Mascot,' who
brought luck to him in whatever he undertook.
That was the principal reason, of course, that
he was so keen on having me name his mine for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
him. I think if I had sowed all my wild oats,
and been willing to settle down a bit into a respectable
member of society, there was a time
when he wouldn't have minded adopting me,
for some old, unhappy love affair or other had
kept him out of the marriage-market, eligible
as he was, and he swore that he never meant
to marry, even for the hope of having an heir
to all his money. Yes, I might have been that
heir if I hadn't been a fool, for Farnham certainly
thought the world and all of me in those
days. As it was, he did me many a kindness."</p>

<p>"And now, by way of repaying that affection
and those kindnesses," I could not help exclaiming,
with a returning touch of the old
bitter contempt, "you've undertaken to help
his murderer to get off scot free. You've been
masquerading in the very clothes the poor fellow
wore, you've been using his luggage, trading
on the likeness to him which once won for
you his regard, heightening it in every way
by artificial means, so that not only shall Carson
Wildred, or Willis Collins, escape suspicion,
but that he may enrich himself on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
dead man's millions. You even set an hotel
on fire to finish the whole fiendish plot with a
fine dramatic effect!"</p>

<p>The poor wretch, who had made such a wreck
of his young life, was white as death, and shaking
like an aspen. I could see the beads of
sweat oozing out on his pale forehead. "For
God's sake," he implored, "don't say that to
me; I can't bear it! Until you told me just
now I swear to you by all I hold sacred&#8211;by
my sister's love, which I so little deserve&#8211;that
I never dreamed of Harvey Farnham's being
dead. You may believe me or not, as you like,
but you're <i>her</i> friend, so I should be glad that
you should believe. And, at least, you owe it
to me in common justice to hear what I've got
to say.</p>

<p>"Collins always managed to keep his eye
on me, and knew my whereabouts and my doings,
making me feel that at any moment he
could come down on me if he chose. I daresay
he had other men in his power like that, men
whom he thought he might wish to make his
tools at one time or other. I didn't often hear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
from him, though I knew myself shadowed,
and knew also, only too well, whom I had to
thank for it. You can't guess the horror of
the feeling, or how it got on my nerves. I
fancied it would drive me to madness or suicide
one day, always knowing I was watched,
that I could never, try as I would, escape that
Eye, which was really Willis Collins's, spying
me out across the ocean.</p>

<p>"Well, a cablegram came from him commanding
rather than asking me to go to England,
saying that it would be much to my
advantage to do so, and that my fare and all
expenses would at once be sent me in advance.
There was just a hint that I had better not refuse,
which I understood as well as if it had
been a definite threat; and, anyhow, there was
a certain attractiveness in the idea of going
home&#8211;I hadn't seen Karine or England for
so long.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to let my sister know of my
presence&#8211;I would have spared her that&#8211;but
I fancied myself standing among the crowd
in the Park, watching her drive by, or something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
of that sort. Even a glimpse of her face
would have been sweet.</p>

<p>"But when I arrived one of the first things
Wildred did was to tell me that he knew the
Tressidys, with whom Karine was living, that
he had heard my sister often speak of me, and
that he would secretly arrange a meeting between
us. I couldn't resist the temptation of
having a few words with her when it was offered
for the asking, and I saw her at the
House by the Lock. An excuse was made to
bring her and Lady Tressidy there&#8211;something
about a portrait of Karine that was in a queer
room called the 'studio'&#8211;and while Wildred
was showing Lady Tressidy over the house I
saw my sister, and had a talk with her. She
felt grateful to Wildred for bringing it about,
and fool that I was, I didn't suspect the deep
game he meant to play with her, using me as
the decoy. I thought he had merely been willing
to take the trouble that he might get the
more work out of me when he wanted it,
though what the work was for which he had
brought me to England I didn't yet know.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>"After that first meeting with Karine I had
given Wildred my word never to try and see
her again; now I understand why. He wished
to revive all the old love she had felt by the
sight of me, awaken her sympathy for my
troubles, when she should learn his version of
them from his lips, and then keep me from her,
lest I should hear that he had asked her to be
his wife, threatening to betray me if she did
not accept, and so, in spite of my cowardice
(for I am a moral coward), setting me against
him, to be his slave and tool no more.</p>

<p>"When I had been in England about three
or four weeks, keeping out of the way of anyone
who might possibly remember me, Wildred
suggested the scheme of my travelling back to
America, impersonating Farnham, and finally
finishing the plot, as I did finish it to-night.
He admitted that it was for this he had sent
for me, but swore Farnham himself was in the
thing as deep as he; that it meant a fortune to
them both, which they were to share, and which
could be had in no other way. He explained
that Farnham had had bad luck in speculations,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
was bankrupt, hadn't the pluck to begin
over again on the lowest rounds of the ladder,
nor to undertake carrying out this plan himself.
He would funk the fire business, Wildred
said, and might, instead of escaping,
actually be burned to death. The object to be
gained, of course, I was made to believe, was
getting the life assurance. Farnham was supposed
to have several policies, each one for an
enormous sum; he had left everything of which
he should die possessed, life assurance and all
the rest, to Wildred, who would actually go
halves with Farnham when the money should
be secured.</p>

<p>"I have nothing of my own, you know, except
what I can make by my wits, for my
father disinherited me, and I've had just a
little too much pride ever to take anything
from Karine. Wildred offered me ten thousand
pounds to work this business for him;
half to be paid down, half when the thing had
been successfully carried through to the close.</p>

<p>"Of course, I had sense enough to know it
was a villainous fraud, but I've never been very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
scrupulous, and it was easy to persuade myself
that I owed Harvey Farnham a good turn
for what he did for me in the past. Besides,
I wanted the money, and there was five thousand
in notes (Wildred was too sly to give a
cheque) on the table for me to take or leave.
I didn't see that I was going to do much harm
to anybody except the insurance companies,
who are rich enough to lose, as Farnham hadn't
a relative in the world; but before heaven, if
I'd dreamed of the truth, I'd have let Wildred
do his worst before I'd have gone in with him.</p>

<p>"As for the Santa Anna, I knew that every
board of the hotel was assured&#8211;the landlord
would lose nothing, and after I'd kindled the
fire I knocked like mad on your door. I fancy,
though you didn't know it, it must have been
that which first began to rouse you. I didn't
give myself much time to get out, after taking
off the disguise (which I flatter myself I did
pretty well), but I just managed it. I can tell
you I was desperate when I walked in here
and found you; but now I was never so thankful
for anything in the course of my life."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>"The present question is, then," I said,
"whether you will go straight to England with
me and tell all you know about Carson Wildred?
If we stopped on this side, to prove
things step by step as we went, we should
labour under two disadvantages. It would
mean indefinite delay, and you would get into
trouble about that business at the hotel to-night.
To sail at once for England, and let
matters here take care of themselves for the
present, is our only plan, I think. What do
you say?"</p>

<p>"You are sure that Wildred can't swear my
life away?"</p>

<p>"As sure as I am that we are both alive at
this moment."</p>

<p>"Then I'm in your hands. I'll save my sister,
and I'll get even with Wildred for making
a tool and a dupe of me."</p>

<p>"By the time we have landed on the other
side," I answered, "there'll still be a clear fortnight
to do the first, and I think we may
accomplish the latter transaction simultaneously."</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span><a id='link_27'></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>Too Late!</span></h2>

<p>We had a stormy passage, and arrived at
Southampton four-and-twenty hours later
than we should have done. It was Cunningham
who bought a paper as we got into the
train. I was too completely preoccupied to
have absorbed a line of news, even had my
eyes mechanically perused the printed matter.
Cunningham (who was always restless, and
could not bear to be left at the mercy of his
own thoughts) read incessantly, however, and
at the end of half an hour or so handed over his
paper to me.</p>

<p>"Look at this," he said, with some eagerness,
pointing out a paragraph. I glanced at
it carelessly at first, but in an instant I was
as keen as Cunningham had been.</p>

<p>"Another Fortune for a Millionaire," the
paragraph was headed, and beneath was set
forth the interesting fact that Mr. Carson Wildred,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
who was shortly to marry Miss Cunningham,
the celebrated beauty and heiress, had
just heard of a legacy of half a million pounds,
left him by an American friend, Mr. Harvey
Farnham, lately burned to death in a San
Francisco hotel.</p>

<p>"So you see it wasn't only the mine, and the
money he should have paid for the mine, he
wanted," said Cunningham. "Oh, he's a
marvellous chap, this Wildred!"</p>

<p>I acquiesced in this opinion, and recalled a
remark made in the club by a mutual acquaintance.
"Carson Wildred is always inheriting
fortunes from chaps that die at the four
corners of the globe," he had curiously announced.
I wondered grimly, as I remembered
the speech, whether all these benefactors had
met their death after the manner of poor Harvey
Farnham.</p>

<p>Time was pressing now, and our idea was
to go straight to Karine, I to appear only as
the supporter of her brother. A desire for the
punishment of Wildred might have held a
prominent place both in Cunningham's mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
and mine, but our first thought was to save
Karine from becoming the murderer's wife.</p>

<p>She must be disabused of the belief that her
brother was in any way in Wildred's power.
She must know that, as Cunningham expressed
it, the "shoe was on the other foot." She must
be shown the black depths of Carson Wildred's
villainy, and be dragged back from the
brink of the precipice on which she had stood.</p>

<p>Ours was a quick train, and went straight
through to London without stopping. After
arriving at Waterloo station, therefore, we
were obliged to wait for nearly an hour before
we could get another which would take us to
Haslemere.</p>

<p>A curious feeling that I had passed through
all this before came over me, and as we stepped
out of our carriage on the platform of the
Haslemere station it seemed but yesterday that
I had arrived at the same place, intent on bidding
Karine that farewell which never had been
spoken.</p>

<p>The time of day gave me the only sense of
difference. We had left the ship early in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
morning, had made our first journey in two
hours, and now it was only very little past
noon.</p>

<p>I had wished (considering the reception I
had met at Sir Walter Tressidy's on my first
and last visit at his country house) to remain
at an hotel in Haslemere, there to await such
news as Cunningham might have to bring.
For Karine's sake, I thought, it would be better
for me not to appear openly in the matter,
unless it proved that the influence of her
brother and his narrative were not as potent
in their effect as I anticipated. Should he require
any attestations from me, I was only
too glad to be on the spot and to be called upon
to give them.</p>

<p>Cunningham, however, had overruled this
programme of mine. No one could tell, he
said, how he might be received. He might be
sorely in need of me to back him up&#8211;perhaps
even to prove the truth of his otherwise unsupported
assertions.</p>

<p>The Tressidys, he alleged, were peculiar.
Though his sister had not confided in him, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
knew that she was unhappy with them. They
had very little money of their own on which to
keep up the appearance they wished to make
in the eyes of their world, and Cunningham
did not believe that Lady Tressidy would be
above accepting a heavy bribe from Wildred
for furthering his suit, by almost any means,
with poor Karine.</p>

<p>Half against my will, therefore, yet not
wholly with reluctance, I must confess, I entered
the carriage which was to drive us both
to the house where a few weeks ago I had been
so ruthlessly repulsed.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" I said, as we rattled up
the hill (perhaps in the same vehicle which had
driven me before), "that the storm wasn't just
a degree more severe in crossing. It was
touch and go with us one day, at all events, I
believe; but a fraction worse, and we shouldn't
have been here now to stand between Miss
Cunningham and that villain. A week or ten
days more, perhaps, and even if we'd reached
her we might have been too late."</p>

<p>There was a certain tumultuous joy in my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
heart, far removed from happiness, yet intoxicating
as new wine. Karine might never be
mine, but she was saved, and it would be I who
had saved her. I could never be regarded by
her quite with indifference after this day.</p>

<p>As we drove we made various hurried plans
as to what we should do if we were refused
admittance. We were determined at least to
see Karine, even if we were obliged to force
our way into her presence.</p>

<p>As we got out of the carriage and ran up
the four or five broad stone steps that led to
the front door, something crackled under our
feet like exaggerated grains of sand. We
were far enough, however, from guessing the
nature of the foreign substance that was thus
crushed beneath our disregarding boot-soles.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a smiling footman.
He was not the man I had previously seen, and
evidently, judging from the genial flush on his
face and the twinkle in his eye, something
agreeable or amusing had recently taken place.
He tried to draw his countenance into the conventional
lines of footman-like solemnity, but,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
his eyes lighting upon Cunningham, the expression
changed to one of surprise. Very
possibly he noted the similarity of colouring
between the brother and sister, and a certain
vague haunting likeness that would show itself
at times.</p>

<p>"If Miss Cunningham is at home, tell her
that her brother has come and wishes to see her
immediately on a matter of importance," said
my companion, valiantly taking the bull by the
horns.</p>

<p>"Miss Cunningham is not at home, sir," replied
the servant. "She&#8211;that is&#8211;in fact, sir,
she has just left us for good and all. She&#8211;she
was married, sir, at half-past ten o'clock
this morning, and the wedding breakfast's only
been over since an hour ago."</p>

<p>The gritty substance under our feet had
been the rice thrown, as though in mockery,
after Karine as she passed to her carriage on
her husband's arm.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A Wild-Goose Chase</span></h2>

<p>"Do you know where the&#8211;the bride and
groom have gone?" questioned Cunningham,
grudgingly.</p>

<p>"No, sir. I heard Lady Tressidy say only
this morning that even she hadn't been told.
Mr. Wildred had some idea of a surprise, I
believe, sir."</p>

<p>The fact that not only had my companion
claimed to be the brother of the bride, but that
his facial expression and colouring answered
for his truth, caused the fellow to feel apparently
that we had a right to explanations.</p>

<p>There was no use in endeavouring to make
further enquiries. Even if Lady Tressidy or
Sir Walter did know the destination of the
newly-wedded pair, it was more than improbable
that they would be ready to share their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
knowledge with us. And it was like Carson
Wildred to be prepared even for the very
emergency which had now arisen, by taking
just such precautions as he had.</p>

<p>Had we not been impatient and chosen the
steep road, less often travelled than the other,
we should no doubt have met the carriage
which drove the bridal couple to the Haslemere
station. Another exemplification of the old
proverb, that "the more haste, the less speed."
We could now only repair our mistake, if it
still admitted of reparation, by giving chase
with such speed as was practicable.</p>

<p>I gave the order to the coachman, "Drive
to the station as quick as you can," and in another
moment we were off.</p>

<p>Fate seemed to have ordained that I should
meet nothing save disappointment at this door;
but to-day's experience had brought me something
far deeper and more cruel than mere disappointment.
I had not counted upon the
chance that Wildred would be permitted to
hurry on the wedding during my absence, and
now I felt as though a chasm had suddenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
yawned under my feet. Karine was Carson
Wildred's wife!</p>

<p>"What are we to do?" questioned her
brother dully. "We can't leave her with him,
you know."</p>

<p>Leave her with him! The very fact that I
was obliged to answer him gave me back the
power of concentrating thought. A moment
before my mind had been a blank, a chaos; but
now I returned, unhesitatingly&#8211;</p>

<p>"We'll find out where they've gone, and
have him arrested and your sister taken from
him before nightfall."</p>

<p>"But supposing they've gone abroad&#8211;which
is what they very likely mean&#8211;before
we can catch them?"</p>

<p>"We <i>must</i> catch them. There won't be a
train till later in the afternoon by which they
can get away now. They'd have to go by the
night boat, if it was France. Somehow or
other&#8211;though everything seems against us,
and we are only two, where there ought to be
a dozen going in as many ways at once&#8211;we'll
circumvent that devil yet."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>"You have plenty of confidence in yourself,"
said Cunningham. "Perhaps you don't
know Carson Wildred as well as I do."</p>

<p>I did not answer, though the words rang
ominously in my ears. I was very busy with
my own thoughts.</p>

<p>As soon as we could find out where Wildred
had taken Karine (even within my own mind
I would not call her his wife), we must lodge
such information with the police that he could
be arrested at once, either on English or
foreign soil, as the case might be. A man accused
of murder, as he would be, could, fortunately,
be apprehended anywhere.</p>

<p>At Haslemere station they could only inform
us that the party of which we were in
search had had tickets for London, and had
left about three-quarters of an hour before our
arrival.</p>

<p>Even if we could have told our story with
sufficient succinctness to have Wildred met at
Waterloo by the police, there would have been
no time to do so. We must simply follow as
we could. Luckily there was a slow train due
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
in a few moments, otherwise I think we (I at
least) must have gone mad with the strain of
waiting.</p>

<p>At Waterloo we heard of them. A porter
had taken their luggage and put it on a cab.
The gentleman and lady had driven away in a
private carriage. What direction had been
given to the coachman or the cabman he had
not happened to hear.</p>

<p>I now proposed that Cunningham should
proceed immediately to Scotland Yard, while
I busied myself elsewhere. He was the one
who could tell of the plot by which he had personated
Farnham in America, by Wildred's
desire, and in the hope of obtaining a substantial
bribe. The authorities were already in
possession of such separate information as I
could give, and now that they would learn
from Cunningham how Farnham had never
gone to America at all, a very different and
more lurid light would be shed upon the past.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I would drive to Charing Cross,
and might yet be in time to intercept the couple
if they were intending to depart for France.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>At Charing Cross they had not appeared,
and hastening to a telegraph office, I sent messages
containing Wildred's description and
Karine's to every one of the principal railway
stations in London. Replies were paid, and
were to be received for me at the Charing
Cross Hotel. Having done so much, I drove
to the piers from which the Holland boats
sailed; then, having discovered nothing, back
to Charing Cross again. The train which
would catch the night boat at Dover was just
about going out, but Wildred and Karine were
not visible.</p>

<p>When the last moment had come and gone
I betook myself to the hotel, where my telegrams
were to await me. I also looked for
Cunningham, who was to have met me there,
after Scotland Yard, and decided upon forthcoming
arrangements. Despatches were awaiting
me from the head porters of various stations&#8211;Victoria,
Euston, Paddington, and so
on&#8211;but no Cunningham had as yet appeared.</p>

<p>I opened the message from Paddington last;
the others had no news for me, but it seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
that at Paddington a lady and gentleman, apparently
answering the description given, had
taken tickets for Maidenhead. All the blood
in my body seemed to mount to my head. Unless
there had been a mistake in the identity,
Wildred must have carried Karine off to the
House by the Lock!</p>

<p>It was horrible to me that she should be
there. The thought of the house, and what I
believed had happened to Harvey Farnham
under its roof, was abhorrent. Why had he
chosen to take his young bride, on the day of
their marriage, to that gloomy and accursed
spot? A strange thrill of apprehension, vague,
yet none the less dreadful, shook my nerves.</p>

<p>I consulted the latest A.B.C. time-table,
which lay in the reading-room of the hotel. In
exactly an hour another train would leave Paddington
for Maidenhead and Marlow (the
nearest stations to Purley Lock), and after
that there would not be another until ten
o'clock.</p>

<p>I should not have much more than time to
catch the former, if I intended to go by it&#8211;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
I <i>did</i> intend to go. Exactly what I was to
do, how I was to get Karine away from her
husband, I did not dare stop to think, but
somehow I would do it. So great was my
dread of Wildred as a criminal, and my respect
for him as a schemer, that I even feared dimly
for Karine's safety with him. It was madness
to entertain such a doubt, I assured myself,
for great heiress as she was, Karine was
lovely enough and sweet enough to inspire
genuine love even in so cold-hearted a villain
as Wildred.</p>

<p>He might tire of her in the end, but for the
present her life, at least, would be safe with
him. So I repeated mentally, over and over
again; but still I was pricked with a boding
fear for more than her peace of mind. Why
had he taken her to that grim, hateful house
by the river?</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span><a id='link_29'></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>At the House by the Lock</span></h2>

<p>I would have wished to wait for Cunningham,
both because I wanted him with me, and
because I was anxious to hear what he had
done at Scotland Yard. However, he did not
come, so I wired him to the latter place, left a
short note for him also at the hotel, to be kept
till called for, and started off in a cab (when I
dared delay no longer) at breakneck pace for
Paddington station.</p>

<p>I just caught the train I wanted, changed
at Maidenhead, and arrived at Marlow by
half-past eight o'clock. This time I had
neither leisure nor inclination to walk, as upon
my first visit to the place on Christmas Day,
but took a fly, and offered the man an extra
fare if he would make haste.</p>

<p>A little short of the House by the Lock I
stopped him. A certain instinct seemed to bid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
me not be too ostentatious in the manner of
announcing my arrival. I got out, and by the
light of a round, red moon rising over black
trees in the east I glanced at my watch. It
was five-and-twenty past nine. The whole day,
since my arrival at Southampton in the morning,
had gone in searching for Karine, and it
might be that I was as far from success now
as I had been in the beginning.</p>

<p>A hundred yards away a small yellow light
shone steadily through the moon-tinged darkness.
I thought it came from the House by
the Lock, though the one poor ray made but
scant cheer of illumination for a bride's homecoming.</p>

<p>"Wait here for me," I said to the driver.
"I may come within half an hour, I may be
much longer; but, at all events, wait. Here is
a sovereign for you, and you shall have as
much again when I return."</p>

<p>The tone of his voice told me that he was
suspicious, as well as curious, regarding the
mysterious intentions of his fare; but I was
sure that he would not fail me. Two pounds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
were not to be so easily picked up every
evening.</p>

<p>I walked on rapidly. As I approached the
House by the Lock I lost sight of the yellow
gleam which for some time had guided me,
but the moon glinted bleakly on the staring
panes of dark, upper windows.</p>

<p>Desolate as the place had appeared at the
hour of sunset, it had had an air of hospitable
welcome at that time compared to that which
it wore now. Never, it seemed to me, had I
seen a habitation so grim, so silently suggestive
of haunting, evil things. The face of the
moon, as it rose, lost the ruddy hue which had
coloured it nearer the horizon, and its paling
disc was swept by black and ragged storm
clouds. The wind moaned through the trees
like the wail of a lost soul, and there was a
stealthy, monotonous lapping of the dark
waters so close at hand.</p>

<p>Other sound there was none, and, though I
had seen the small ray from a distance, now&#8211;so
far as I could ascertain&#8211;not a window in
the whole gloomy pile was lighted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>I went up the path, knocked, and rang the
bell, which sent back jangling echoes, such as
belong in one's fancy to an uninhabited house.
From a distant kennel a dog began to bay.
Otherwise I was not answered, and as I rang
and thundered on the knocker again, the animal's
voice at length subsided into a protesting whine.</p>

<p>I ought by this time to have been sure that
Wildred and Karine were not in the house,
but, on the contrary, I was by no means certain
of that fact. Mentally I argued that, if the
master was absent, a caretaker or servant
would certainly have been left, and unless a
stone-deaf person had been selected for the
post my violent alarms would have brought
him to me.</p>

<p>If any reason existed, however, why the door
should not be opened, it would be easy to understand
how and why the caretaker might be
suddenly afflicted with an inability to hear.</p>

<p>Instead of being plunged into discouragement,
an ever-kindling fire of rage mounted
within me. Rather than go away ignorant as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
to whether Karine was hidden in this hateful
house or not, I would force an entrance. I
sprang down the steps and went to one of the
bow windows nearest the door.</p>

<p>Not an instant's hesitation had I in kicking
in one of the panes of glass, but, as it happened,
I had only my trouble for my pains.
There were solidly-barred shutters inside, so
heavy that even I, strong man as I was, could
not break them open.</p>

<p>Furious now, I ran up to the door again,
and drove my gloved fist through the glass in
one of the curious, six-inch-wide window panes
that ran the length of the door on either side.
The shivered glass jingled sharply on the polished
wood of the floor inside, and I thrust in
my arm up to the elbow, hoping to get at the
lock on the door within. As I did so footsteps
came running in the distance.</p>

<p>"Here! Here! What's the matter with
you?" cried an imperative voice.</p>

<p>I had heard it before, I remembered. It was
that of the eminently respectable-looking servant
who had so cleverly defended his master's
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
reputation on the occasion of my former visit
to the House by the Lock.</p>

<p>"If you're a burglar," remarked the voice,
"you'd better go away while you can. I have
a revolver, and my hand is on the trigger
now."</p>

<p>"I am no burglar," I returned. "This is
not exactly the time of night to expect such
gentry, is it? But you've kept me waiting long
enough. I wish to see your master and mistress,
whom I happen to know are here this
evening, and I don't mean to go away without
doing it."</p>

<p>The man inside chuckled.</p>

<p>"Nice way of announcing yourself, ain't
it, sir? But as it happens you'll have to go
elsewhere to see my master and the new mistress.
I don't know where they are&#8211;it ain't
likely I should&#8211;but I <i>do</i> know they aren't in
<i>this</i> house, where there isn't a solitary soul but
me. As for the time of night, that's neither
here nor there, so long as I'd chosen to go to
bed; and I can't dress all of a minute to please
anybody that likes to come banging at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
door. You deserve to be had up for damaging
the house, that you do, whoever you may
be."</p>

<p>There was a ring of virtuous indignation in
the voice, and for a few seconds' length I hesitated.
Perhaps, after all, the fellow was telling
the truth. I was very certain of his
capacity for lying, but it might well be that
Wildred and Karine had not really come here.
Still&#8213;</p>

<p>Far away a door slammed sharply, and just
in time to decide me. The man <i>had</i> lied. He
had just told me that he was alone in the house,
and this one sound had unmistakably proved
the falsehood. It was not the sort of noise
with which the wind shuts a door, even had the
wind been violent enough to do so, and windows
open to admit it. The latch had been
lifted by a human hand.</p>

<p>The servant, who was entirely out of my
sight, began talking hurriedly, jabbering any
nonsense, as though to cover what had happened.
I listened intently, and through his
chattering I fancied that I could hear&#8211;subdued
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
with distance and intervening walls&#8211;the
sound of a woman's crying.</p>

<p>My heart seemed to leap into my throat. I
could feel the blood throbbing almost to bursting
at my temples.</p>

<p>"You liar!" I roughly exclaimed. "They
<i>are</i> here, and I will see them, if I have to break
the door down!"</p>

<p>"Try it, then!" the man cried, tauntingly.
"Just try it&#8211;and you may try all night. Ta,
ta! Good-bye, and good luck to you!"</p>

<p>I heard his feet tapping swiftly along the
uncovered floor as he ran away. Another door
was opened and closed, and he was out of earshot.</p>

<p>Desperately I again endeavoured to find the
lock. It was no use. Thrust in my arm as
far as I might I could not touch it, and though
I broke the narrow pane on the other side as
well, the fastenings of the door were beyond
my reach.</p>

<p>With all my strength I flung myself against
the door, but the heavy wood stood firm as
though it had been a sheet of iron. There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
evidently no hope in that direction, and dizzy
with my own rage and desperation, I began
attempting some of the windows. But all
were secured with the impregnable shutters
and bars inside, and it would have seemed that
the inmates of the House by the Lock were
prepared to stand a siege.</p>

<p>Whether it was Karine whom I believed I
had heard weeping or not, I could not be sure.
I could not even have taken my oath that there
had been such a sound at all, but I was morally
certain of it.</p>

<p>I ran round the house, trying in vain to batter
in another door, and was met everywhere
by silence and darkness. At the side, however,
I came at last upon the extension with
the tower, whence I had seen the suspicious
smoke and flame pouring on that memorable
Christmas afternoon. Over the roof of the
low "studio," which possessed no windows, I
could see a faint yellow glow, like a luminous
halo or crown, and suddenly, as I stood regarding
it in some bewilderment, I recollected
the skylight which I had observed from within.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>If I could in some way climb to the top,
break through the glass and let myself down,
the problem as to how I should get into the
house would be effectually solved.</p>

<p>It now struck me that the studio, as seen
from outside, was disproportionately large
compared with the room inside, as I remembered
it. There had been only the one, which
apparently constituted the sole purpose of the
building, and yet it appeared to me that there
might have been space for two of the same
small size.</p>

<p>Low as the erection was it was too high for
me to climb, and I began hastily looking about
for some means of assistance in carrying out
my plan.</p>

<p>In the coach-house, I thought, there might
be a ladder, and thither I repaired without delay.
But the doors were padlocked, and try
them as I might I could not open them.</p>

<p>What was I to do? The more difficulties
which encumbered my path, the more did I
determine to surmount them. Returning towards
the house I noticed a large rustic seat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
placed under an ancient apple tree, and it
occurred to me that if I could balance the
article against the projection of the building I
might, by standing it on end, use it as an improvised
ladder. If I could only mount for a
certain distance I could pull myself up by the
ledge of stonework which ran along the edge
of the flat roof.</p>

<p>The light which apparently filtered through
the skylight had warned me to be cautious in
my movements. Whoever was in the house
must have known long ago that someone was
determined upon forcing an entrance, but,
judging by the laughing taunts of the servant,
it would be believed that the boast had been a
vain one.</p>

<p>If anyone was in the studio it might be as
well if, for a few moments at least, I could see
without being seen or heard. I therefore went
about my preparations as quietly as possible.</p>

<p>I dragged the rustic seat across the grass
and set it in an angle between the tower and
the low building of the studio, giving it a certain
slanting inclination, that it might not fall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
when burdened with my weight. Then I
scrambled up, not venturing to pause for an
instant at the top, for I could feel that the
thing was slowly beginning to slide from under
me.</p>

<p>With a leap I caught the ledge of stone that
ran round the roof, and setting my knee
against the wall, helped myself up. It may
read simply enough when written down in
black and white, but it was rather a difficult
task in the accomplishment, and I felt that I
had reason to congratulate myself on my own
success when it was done.</p>

<p>Framed in a margin of dark roof eight to
ten feet in width was the skylight, through
which penetrated a subdued radiance.</p>

<p>Cautiously, noiselessly, I crawled to the
round bubble of glass and looked down. A
curtain of embroidered Indian silk was drawn
half across, but through the open space that
was left I could see something of the interior.</p>

<p>The jewelled lamp which I had previously
observed hanging from the centre alone illumined
the octagonal room. Now that I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
on the roof I was able to appreciate more than
ever the smallness of the studio. There was
space for a wide passage running all the way
round, between the inner walls and the outer
walls. I suspected method in this design&#8211;a
secret which Wildred had cleverly contrived to
hide, and which, in conjunction with the mystery
of the tower, might account for much that
had been dark before.</p>

<p>As I looked a figure passed into my line of
vision. It was Wildred walking restlessly up
and down with his hands behind him. I could
hear the murmur of his voice, though through
the glass of the skylight the words were not
distinguishable.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a sharp exclamation in
a woman's voice, and my heart gave a responsive
bound. Wildred was talking to Karine,
and it was she who had answered him with a
cry.</p>

<p>I had not expected, when I decided upon
trying to enter like a burglar through the skylight,
that Karine would be in the studio. It
would doubtless frighten her very much if I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
should suddenly make my appearance beside
her amid a shower of broken glass, and I
hesitated so to alarm her, unless the man down
there was already commencing to use his power
to torment her. If she would only go out and
leave me to give Wildred a surprise I would
have been thankful; but as I could not hope
for her to do that, I determined to know what
her companion was saying to her, which had
caused her to exclaim in astonishment or perhaps
in fear.</p>

<p>I took out my pocket-knife, and with great
care to avoid all noise I began to loosen one of
the small diamond-shaped panes from its
leaden setting. As soon as it was released at
one end I slipped the point of the knife underneath
and so raised it that there might be no
danger of its falling downward and startling
those within the room.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span><a id='link_30'></a>CHAPTER XXX<br /><span class='h2fs'>Conclusion</span></h2>

<p>I bent my ear over the tiny aperture. It
made all the difference in the world. I could
now hear every word that Wildred was saying.</p>

<p>"I have always, and with some reason, I
think," was the first sentence that I caught,
"considered myself a man of more than average
mental ability. I am usually prepared for
any traps which can possibly be sprung for me;
but in this instance I find I have made my one
mistake. I believed in a woman's devotion.
Probably it serves me right to have been deceived.
Since you have found it all out
through her, I may as well admit to you that
it is true. She did live here. Nobody suspected
her presence, or even her existence. She
was very useful to me in many ways. If she
had proved troublesome I could have rid myself
of her at any time, and she knew it. Instead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
of doing what I ought to have done, I
believed that she was willing to go away
without betraying me, and I let her go free
with a present of a thousand pounds. She
could even have asked for more when that was
gone, and I would not have refused her. I was
a fool ever to marry her, but she was the handsomest
woman I had seen at that time, and as
you know I was some years younger, some degrees
more impulsive than I am now. I was
still more of a fool not to have put her out of
the way, knowing what she did&#8211;but as I remarked,
that was the mistake of a lifetime.
She has told you such of my secrets as she
knew, she has shown you certain things in this
house which have very naturally displeased and
shocked you. She timed her return very well&#8211;jealous
idiot!&#8211;but she will pay for what she
has done."</p>

<p>"How will she pay?"</p>

<p>I could not see Karine, but I could hear her
voice, vibrant with the fear and horror that she
felt.</p>

<p>"Better not ask; the question doesn't concern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
you. She will simply become familiarised
with the secrets of the House by the Lock
in a manner upon which she didn't count, that's
all."</p>

<p>"I had never pictured Satan himself so
cruel, so horrible as you," cried Karine. "I
thank heaven, now that I know through this
wretched woman what you really are, that not
I, but she is your wife!"</p>

<p>"Yet you must remain with me, as though
you knew nothing but what I would have
had you know, for your own sake and your
brother's.</p>

<p>"Had it not been for that foolish creature,
who has ruined herself in trying to ruin you
and me, we might have been happy together,
Karine. I admire you more than any woman
on earth, for you are certainly the most beautiful,
and your coldness to a man of my temperament
has only added to your attractions
as a girl. As a married woman it would have
been different. I meant to make you love me;
and even now, Karine, what has happened that
need change anything between us? You are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
not a conventional little fool, as are some
women I could name, and the love of a man
like me must create some impression on your
nature. The obstacle which you think stands
between us shall be removed, the marriage
ceremony can again be performed over us&#8211;secretly,
if you choose. No one will be the
wiser, and as in any event you must stay here
in my house&#8213;"</p>

<p>"I will not. Somehow God will help me to
escape, and then, when I am free from you, I
shall let such friends as I may have left deal
with you as you deserve."</p>

<p>"It's difficult to see how you will get away.
It's true I did not dream that Marion would be
here to greet us or I would not have brought
you to this house. But now that you are in it
you will stay. No one knows that we are here&#8211;no
one in your world, at least&#8211;and I intend
that we shall have a protracted honeymoon.
You heard how some vagabond, some tramp
who wished to get in, failed just now? Well,
it is just as difficult for strangers to <i>escape</i>
from the House by the Lock as it is for them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
to effect an entrance. For instance, you and I
are now cut off by means of a sliding iron door
from the old portion of the house. From this
there is absolutely no way out, unless I allow it,
save one, and that way two or three people have
already found by going through a certain little
door hidden behind the hangings. I'll show
it to you, if you like, or perhaps the lady
who told you so much has told you that as
well?"</p>

<p>"She has. She told me all about poor Mr.
Farnham, how you made him believe you a
friend to be trusted, how you induced him to
smoke opium&#8211;here in this very room&#8211;this
awful room&#8211;till he was dazed and unconscious,
and how he only roused from his stupor
just as you were going to burn him alive in
your horrible crematory. She told me how the
furnace went wrong at the last moment and
you had to kill him in a different way from
what you had planned&#8211;less easy for you, more
dangerous of discovery. Oh, the horror of
listening to those details, for she spared me
nothing&#8211;nothing! I heard from her how Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
Stanton came in the midst of the dreadful happenings
on Christmas Day, how she saw him
through the door, and afterwards, when he had
spoken to the police, how you bribed her with
jewels and money to pretend that she was your
cook, that she had screamed with the pain of
burning her foot, and how she painted her
ankle to look like a red scar when she had to
show some proof of her story. She would
have been true to you through everything, she
said&#8211;poor misguided woman&#8211;if she had not
been taken ill and stopped in London instead
of going to France, as she had promised, and
so seen in the papers about our coming marriage.
What mockery to call it that; and yet, I
thank heaven that it need only be mockery&#8211;that
it is not real.</p>

<p>"I wonder that the shock of finding that
woman concealed in my room&#8211;waiting for me
to come&#8211;did not drive me mad. But I am not
mad, and such wit as I have I warn you I shall
devote to thwarting you, Carson Wildred. Do
you think I could go on living under the same
roof with you, even if I were in reality your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
wife? No, you can kill me if you like; it
is the only way in which you can keep me
here."</p>

<p>He did not answer for an instant, then he
said slowly, "Do you remember just putting
your name on a paper I asked you to sign for
me with my stylographic pen in the train this
afternoon? Well, you thought it was merely an
order for letters to be sent on to your new address,
but it was something rather more important
than that. You put your name to a
document which leaves all the money of which
you die possessed unreservedly to me. I have
already had it witnessed by my servant and
another. You understand to what this points,
perhaps? If you show yourself amenable to
reason I shall consider you a wife to be proud
of, and there is no ambition which we need
cherish in vain if we are to live our lives together.
But, on the other hand, unless you
will go heart and soul with me, ignoring the
past, you have to-day been told too much for
my safety or&#8211;<i>your own</i>. What if you should
catch a serious cold here at the House by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
Lock? Unfortunately, the place is rather
damp, though so charming in many ways.
You might have an attack of pneumonia. Only
fancy how the world would sympathise with the
husband of so beautiful and popular a girl as
yourself if he were bereaved of you during the
honeymoon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are horrible&#8211;horrible! It is like
death even to listen to you!" cried Karine.
"If only there was a soul on earth to help me&#8211;but
there's none&#8211;none!"</p>

<p>His answer, if he had made one, was
drowned in the crashing of glass. Better that
she should be startled, even to the point of
swooning, rather than endure for another second
the torture that that fiend was inflicting
upon her.</p>

<p>I broke in the skylight with the heavy stick
which I had brought up to the roof between
my teeth. Then, with hands cut and bleeding,
despite the protection of my gloves, I swung
myself down and dropped on to the floor.</p>

<p>There was a cry from Karine, and a sharp
exclamation of dismayed astonishment from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
Wildred, for once outwitted. I had never
been a match for him in diplomacy, but when it
came to a physical encounter, I had every advantage
over him, and I knew it.</p>

<p>He had no time to pull out the knife or
revolver, for which his hand flew to his pocket,
for I was on him, taking him by the throat and
shaking him as a terrier shakes a rat.</p>

<p>I had not stopped even to look at Karine,
and yet the vision of her pale face and hands
clasped over her bosom had flashed, lightning-like,
upon my consciousness. "Thank heaven!
thank heaven!" I could hear her sob. I
hoped that she did not look&#8211;that she had
closed her eyes, or covered them with her hands,
but Wildred did not give me time to make suggestions.
He was more nimble, if he was less
strong, than I.</p>

<p>I could feel, through all his writhings, that
he was trying to force me along with him towards
a certain corner of the room, and, realising
it, resolved to thwart him, whatever his
object might be. I had come to the knowledge
exactly one second too late, however. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
managed to place his foot on a bell concealed
under one of the rugs on the floor, and I heard
its summons go pealing shrilly out through the
house.</p>

<p>I remembered how I had looked for a bell in
this room once before; it was scarcely to be
wondered at, considering its position, that I
had not found it.</p>

<p>In another moment the servant-accomplice
would come to the assistance of his master.
Had it not been for Karine's presence I felt
that I should not have found it difficult in my
present mood to have held them both in check,
but as it was I should greatly have preferred
only one antagonist.</p>

<p>The struggle in which I was engaged with
Wildred had degenerated into a species of
wrestling match. I had him down on one knee
at last, and bending his arms behind him while
he poured forth a volley of deadly oaths&#8211;his
strange, light eyes flashing into mine&#8211;I attempted
to tie his hands together with my silk
handkerchief, wound into a slip-knot I had
learned to make at sea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>He was slippery as a serpent in my grasp,
and it was taking all I knew to manage him,
when a cry from Karine gave me the first warning
that I was attacked from behind.</p>

<p>The confidential man had stolen in as noiselessly
as I had crept upon the roof and to the
skylight.</p>

<p>"Take that, then!" I heard him snarl savagely,
and a low exclamation from my darling
told me that in some way he had revenged
himself upon her. For an instant I lost my
presence of mind and my hold upon Wildred.
Involuntarily I turned to go to Karine's rescue,
and the movement was a fatal one. Wildred
was up like a rod of steel that has been forcibly
bent backward. The two threw themselves
upon me together. I felt a sharp, hot pain
run fiercely through my side, and knew that I
had been stabbed. My one thought was for
the girl. If they worked their will upon me,
and killed me before her eyes, what was to become
of her?</p>

<p>"Run, Karine&#8211;escape!" I panted. I could
not see her, but I was assured that she had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
obeyed by the loud screams for help which she
was desperately uttering.</p>

<p>Again I got Wildred down, but the other
man was on top of me, and for the second time
I felt the burning pain, this time in my
shoulder. I fought like a mad creature now,
with the intent to kill, which I had not had before;
but the conviction grew within me that,
battle as I might, the effort would be all in
vain.</p>

<p>Sparks danced before my eyes, and then
everything grew dim. Out of chaos came a
shriek from Karine. Could it be a cry of joy?
What reason was there for rejoicing?</p>

<p>But there followed a renewed crashing of
glass, the muffled thud of feet descending from
a height upon the soft surface of rugs, and the
sound of men's voices.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that Cunningham's was
among them, but a strange, cold pall of darkness
enveloped me, and I knew no more.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Afterwards I learned how it was that
Cunningham, with two detectives from Scotland
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>
Yard, had arrived in the very "nick of
time."</p>

<p>His statements to the police authorities had
been necessarily so elaborate, and had been
deemed so extraordinary, that it had taken
some time to create the desired impression at
headquarters.</p>

<p>He had been still at "The Yard" when my
wire had arrived. When at last he had induced
the "powers that be" to grant a warrant for
Wildred's arrest on suspicion of having murdered
Harvey Farnham, and to send a couple
of men to the House by the Lock, where my
telegram had announced that he was probably
to be found, it was too late to catch anything
save the ten o'clock train.</p>

<p>Having reached the door of the grim old
mansion, Karine's cries for help, ringing out
upon the night through the broken skylight,
had told them in which direction to proceed,
and they had used the same method of surmounting
the obstacles which I had adopted
and left for them.</p>

<p>The servant was secured, but Wildred, seeing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>
with his usual quickness that all hope of
escape was over, had shot himself through the
heart before the officers could reach him. So
died a man who had accomplished the death of
many another, and through his humble accomplice
(who now breaks stones at Portland),
and the wretched wife found prisoned in a
room upstairs, the secrets of his numerous
crimes and the dark House by the Lock were
revealed.</p>

<p>It was not for many a day after that night's
terrible experience that I heard all the truth.
What with the two wounds I had received, and
the strain of the past few weeks, which had
begun to tell upon me at last, for a time I lay
in rather a precarious condition. But one
morning I woke to consciousness, and found
that the beautiful face which had been near me
in my dreams was present in reality. Karine
and her brother had nursed me through more
than a fortnight's illness.</p>

<p>Had I been quite myself I would have felt
that then was not the time to speak of love to
the girl who had endured so much. But the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span>
words were uttered before my judgment would
let me restrain them, as it so often had done in
the first sweet, sad days of our acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," I said weakly. "I'm a
brute. You've been such an angel to me&#8211;and
I oughtn't to have told you now."</p>

<p>"Oughtn't you?" she answered softly.
"Do you remember my saying one evening at
the Savoy Hotel that there was only one thing
in the world which might even then keep me
from making a marriage that was horrible to
me?"</p>

<p>"I remember well," I returned. "I remember
everything you ever said to me. Will you
tell me what that one thing was?"</p>

<p>"I meant <i>if you had loved me</i>. Sometimes
I&#8211;thought you did, but you would never say
so. You only asked to be 'my friend.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, if I had but known&#8211;if I had but
dared!" I exclaimed. "I was perishing of
love for you from the first night I ever saw
your face. Is it too late now? I don't ask to
be your friend, I ask to be everything&#8211;your
lover, and your husband."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span>"And I <i>give</i> you everything," she said.</p>

<p>So it came about that the sunshine of happiness
drove forth the black shadows which would
fain have lingered to haunt us like ghosts from
the House by the Lock.</p>
